<h2>AUTHOR'S NOTE</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">I desire</span> simply to say that I commenced taking
an active interest in submarines in 1904. I wrote
my first book on the subject, <i>Submarines of the
World's Navies</i>, in 1910, and I have watched and
written of the rise of these and kindred weapons
for the past fifteen years of rapid development in
peace and war, finally taking a humble part in
the defeat of the great German submarine armada
during the years 1914-1918.</div>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">While</span> Great Britain remains an island, with
dominion over palm and pine, it is to the sea that
her four hundred millions of people must look for
the key to all that has been achieved in the past
and all that the future promises in the quickening
dawn of a new era.</div>

<p>Not only over Great Britain alone, however, does
the ocean cast its spell, for it is the free highway of
the world, sailed by the ships of all nations, without
other hindrances than those of stormy nature,
and navigated without restriction from pole to
pole by the seamen of all races. It was the
international meeting-place, where ensigns were
"dipped" in friendly greeting, and since the dawn
of history there has been a freemasonry of the
sea which knew no distinction of nation or
creed.</p>

<p>When the call of humanity boomed across the
dark, storm-tossed waters the answer came readily
from beneath whatever flag the sound was heard.
But in August, 1914, there came a change, so
dramatic, so sudden, that maritime nations were
stunned. Germany, in an excess of war fever,
broke the sea laws, and laughed while women and
children drowned. Crime followed crime, and the
great voice of the Republican West protested in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
unison with that of the Imperial East. Still the
Black Eagle laughed as it flew far and wide, carrying
death to whomsoever came within its shadow,
regardless of race and sex.</p>

<p>But there was an avenger upon the seas, one
who had been rocked in its cradle from time immemorial,
and to whom the world appealed to save
the lives of their seamen. It sailed beneath the
White Ensign and the Blue, and with aid from
France, Italy and Japan it fought by day and by
night, in winter gale and snow, and in summer heat
and fog, in torrid zone and regions of perpetual ice
to free the seas of the traitorous monster who had,
in the twentieth century, hoisted the black flag of
piracy and murder. For three years this ceaseless
war was waged, and then, with her wonderful
patience exhausted, the great sister nation of the
mother tongue joined her fleets and armies with
those of the battle-worn Allies and peace came to
a long-suffering world.</p>

<p>In that abyss of war there was romance sufficient
for many generations of novelists and historians.
Many were the epic fights, unimportant in themselves,
but which need only a Kingsley or a Stevenson
to make them famous for all time. So with
the happenings to be described in this book, many
of them historically unimportant compared with
the epoch-making events of which they formed a
decimal part, but told in plain words; just records
of romance on England's sea frontier in the years
1914-1918.</p>

<p>Although jealous of any encroachment on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
space available for the description of guerrilla war
at sea, there are many things which must first be
said regarding the organisation and training of
what may appropriately be termed the "New
Navy," which took the sea to combat the submarine
and the mine; also of the novel weapons
devised amid the whirl of war for their use, protection
and offensive power. Into this brief
recital of the events leading to the real thing an
endeavour will be made to infuse the life and local
colour, which, however, would be more appropriate
in a personal narrative than in a general
description of anti-submarine warfare of to-day,
but without which much that is essential could not
be written without dire risk of tiring the reader
before the first few chapters had been passed.</p>

<p>The names of places and ships have necessarily
been changed to avoid anything of a personal
character, and all references to existing or dead
officers and men have been rigidly excluded as
objectionable and unnecessary in a book dealing
entirely with events.</p>

<p>Many of the incidents described&mdash;written while
the events stood out in clear, mental perspective&mdash;could
no doubt be duplicated and easily surpassed
by many whose fortunes took them into zones of
sea war during the historic years just past. If
such is found to be the case, then the object of this
book has been accomplished, for it sets out to tell,
not of great epoch-making events, but of the
organisation, men, ships, weapons and ordinary
incidents of life in what, for lack of a better term,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
has been called the "New Navy"&mdash;a production
of the World War.</p>

<p>It may be that an apology is due for placing yet
another war book before a war-weary public, but
an effort has been made to make of the following
chapters <i>a record of British maritime achievement</i>,
more than a narrative of sea fighting, although to
do this without introducing the human element,
the arduous nature of the work, the monotony, the
danger and, finally, the compensating moments of
excitement would have been to falsify the account
and belittle the achievement.</p>

<p>There are many books available, full of exciting
stories of sea and land war, but no other, so far as
the Author knows, which describes in detail and in
plain phraseology those important "little things"&mdash;liable
to be overlooked amid the whirl of war&mdash;which
go to make an anti-submarine personnel,
fleet and base, together with an account of "how
it was done."</p>

<h2>SUBMARINE WARFARE<br />

OF TO-DAY</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE TASK OF THE ALLIED NAVIES</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> hour was that of the Allies' greatest need&mdash;the
last months of the year 1914. On that fateful
4th August the British navy was concentrated in
the North Sea, and the chance for a surprise attack
by the German fleet, or an invasion of England by
the Kaiser's armies, vanished for ever, and with
this one chance went also all reasonable possibility
of a crushing German victory.</div>

<p>Although during the years of bitter warfare
which followed this silent <i>coup de main</i> the
German fleet many times showed signs of awakening
ambition, it did not, after Jutland, dare to
thrust even its vanguard far into the open sea.
Behind its forts, mines and submarines it waited,
growing weaker with the dry-rot of inaction, for
the chance that fickle Fortune might place a single
unit of the Allied fleet within easy reach of its
whole mailed-fist.</p>

<p>With a great and modern fleet&mdash;the second
strongest in the world&mdash;awaiting its chance less
than twenty hours' steam from the coast of Great
Britain, it quickly became evident that the old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Mistress of the Seas would have to call upon her
islanders to supply a "new navy" to scour the
oceans while her main battle squadrons waited
and watched for the second Trafalgar.</p>

<p>Faced, then, with the problem of a long blockade,
a powerful fleet in readiness to strike at any
weak or unduly exposed point of land or squadron,
and with similar problems on a decreasing scale
imposed by Austria in the Adriatic and by Turkey
behind the Dardanelles, the work of the main
battle fleets became well defined by the commonest
laws of naval strategy.</p>

<p>All this without taking into account the widespread
menace of submarines and mines, and, in
the earlier stages of the war, the rounding-up of
detached enemy squadrons, such as that under
Von Spee in South American waters, and the
protection of the transport and food ships from
raiders like the <i>Wolfe</i> and the <i>Moewe</i>.</p>

<p>The German High Command realised this as
quickly as that of the Allies. Their oversea commerce
was strangled within a few days of the
Declaration of War with Great Britain, and their
fleet was confined to harbour, with the exception
of occasional operations against Russia in the
Baltic. From the German standpoint the naval
problem resolved itself into one of how best to
strike at the lines of communication of the Allies,
paying special attention, first, to the transport of
troops, and, second, to England's food supply. As
they alone knew to what extent they would violate
the laws of war and of humanity, it became apparent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
that the submarine and the mine were the only
possible weapons which could be used for this
purpose in face of the superior fleets of the Allies.
But the number of these weapons was strictly
limited compared with the immense shipping resources
at the command of the Western Powers,
so one submarine must do the work of many, and
an effort was made to accomplish this by a reign
of sea terrorism and inhuman conduct unparalleled
in the history of the world. It opened with the
sinking of the <i>Lusitania</i>.</p>

<p>The Allies had secured and maintained the command
of the sea, and <i>all that it implies</i>, but to do
this with the certainty of correct strategy they
had to dedicate almost their entire battle fleet to
the purpose for which battle fleets have always
been intended&mdash;the checkmating or annihilation
of the opposing navy.</p>

<p>There came a second problem, however, one
entirely new to sea warfare, and unconsidered or
provided against in its strategic and tactical entirety
because hitherto deemed too inhuman for
modern war. This was the ruthless use of armed
submarines against unarmed passenger and
merchant ships, and the scattering broadcast over
the seas, regardless of the lives and property of
neutrals, of thousands of explosive mines.</p>

<p>The type of ship constructed exclusively for
open sea warfare against surface adversaries was
not the best answer to the submarine. The blockading
of the hostile surface fleet did not prevent, or
even greatly hinder, the free passage of submarine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
flotillas, and the building by Germany of under-water
mine-layers enabled fields of these weapons
to be laid anywhere within the carrier's radius of
action.</p>

<p>In this way the second, or submarine, phase of
the naval war opened, and it was to supplement
the comparatively few fast destroyers and other
suitable ships which could be spared from the
main fleets that the "new navy" was formed.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Ships</span></div>

<p>The area of the North Sea alone exceeds 140,000
square miles, and when the whole vast stretch of
water encompassed by what was known as the
radius of action of hostile submarines, from their
bases on the German, Belgian, Austrian, Turkish
and Bulgarian coasts, had to be considered as
a possible zone of operations for German and
Austrian under-water flotillas, much of the water
surface of the world was included. Likewise the
network of sea communications on which the
Allies depended for the maintenance of essential
transport and communication comprised the pathways
of the seven seas. To patrol all these routes
adequately, and to guard the food and troop ships,
hastening in large numbers to the aid of the
Motherland from the most distant corners of the
earth; to protect the 1500 miles sea frontier of
the British Isles; to give timely aid to sinking or
hard-pressed units of the mercantile fleet; to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
hound the submarine from the under-seas and to
sweep clear, almost weekly, several thousand
square miles of sea, from Belle Isle to Cape Town
and the Orkneys to Colombo, required ships, not
in tens, but in thousands. To find these in an incredibly
short space of time became the primary
naval need of the moment.</p>

<p>Who that lived through those days will forget
the struggle to supply ships and guns? The
searching of every harbour for craft, from motor
boats to old-time sailing-ships, and from fishing
craft to liners. The scouring of the Dominions
and Colonies. How blessed was their aid! Help,
generous and spontaneous, came from all quarters,
including the most unexpected. Over five
hundred fast patrol boats, or motor launches, in
less than twelve months from Canada and America.
Guns from Japan. Coasting steamers from India,
Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Seaplanes
from the Crown Colonies. Rifles from
Canada. Machine guns from the United States.
Ambulances from English and Colonial women's
leagues. In fact, contributions to the "new
navy" from all corners of the earth.</p>

<p>To patrol the coasts of Britain alone, and to keep
its harbours and coastal trade routes clear of
mines, needed over 3500 ships, with at least an
equal number of guns, 30,000 rifles and revolvers,
and millions of shells.</p>

<p>In addition to this huge fleet other smaller
squadrons were required for the Mediterranean,
the Suez Canal and Red Sea, the East and West<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Indies, the coasts of the Dominions and Colonies,
and for the Russian lines of communication in the
White Sea. For these oversea bases just under
1000 ships were required, exclusive of those locally
supplied by the Dominions and Colonies themselves.</p>

<p>All this without considering the main battle
fleets or, in fact, any portion of the regular navy,
and the ships required for the transport of food,
troops and munitions of war, together with their
escorts. Some idea of the numbers engaged in
keeping the Allies supplied with the diverse
necessities of life and war may be gathered from
the fact that the average sailings in and out of
the harbours of the United Kingdom alone during
the four years of war amounted to over 1200
a week.</p>

<p>The immense fleet forming the new navy was
not homogeneous in design, power, appearance or,
in fact, in anything except the spirit of the personnel
and the flag beneath which they fought&mdash;and
alas! nearly 4000 died. The squadrons, or
units, as they were called, consisted of fine steam
yachts, liners from the ocean trade routes, sturdy
sea tramps, deep-sea trawlers, oilers, colliers,
drifters, paddle steamers, and the more uniform
and specially built fighting sloops, whalers, motor
launches and coastal motor boats. The latter
type of craft was aided by its great speed, nearly
fifty miles an hour; but more about these ships
and their curious armament later.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">War Bases</span></div>

<p>The great auxiliary navy had to be built or
obtained without depleting the ordinary mercantile
fleets, and the shipbuilding and repairing yards,
even in the smallest sea and river ports, worked
day and night. The triumph was as wonderful as
it was speedy. In less than fifteen months from
August, 1914, the new navy was a gigantic force,
and its operations extended from the Arctic Sea
to the Equator. All units were armed, manned
and linked up by wireless and a common cause.</p>

<p>Before this could be accomplished, however,
the problem of maintaining this vast fleet and
adequately controlling its operations had to be
faced and overcome. The seas adjacent to the
coasts of the United Kingdom, the Mediterranean
Littoral and Colonial waters were divided into
"patrol areas" on special secret charts, and each
"area" had its own naval base, with harbour,
stores, repairing and docking facilities, intelligence
centre, wireless and signal stations, reserve
of officers and men, social headquarters, workshops
and medical department.</p>

<p>Each base was under the command of an
admiral and staff, many of the former returning
to duty, after several years of well-earned rest, as
captains and commodores, with salaries commensurate
with their reduced rank. Their staffs consisted
of some six to twelve officers of the new
navy, with possibly one or two from the "pukka
service," and their command often extended over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
many hundreds of square miles of submarine and
mine infested sea.</p>

<p>Of these bases, which will be fully described in
later chapters, there were about fifty, excluding
the great dockyards and fleet headquarters, but
inclusive of those situated overseas. When it is
considered what a war base needs to make it an
efficient rendezvous for some hundreds of ships
and thousands of men, some idea of the gigantic
task of organisation which their establishment,
often in poorly equipped harbours and distant
islands, required, not only in the first instance, but
also with regard to maintenance and supplies, will
be realised, perhaps, however, more fully when it
is stated that the average ship needs a month spent
in docking and overhauling at least once a year,
and that the delicate and more speedy units of
such a fleet need nearly four times that amount of
attention.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Headquarters Staff</span></div>

<p>One of the first requisites of the auxiliary navy
was the creation of a headquarters staff at the
Admiralty, London. This was formed from naval
officers of experience both in the regular service
and in the two reserves (R.N.R. and R.N.V.R.).</p>

<p>Forming an integral part of the great British or
Allied armada, all operations were under the control
of the Naval War Staff, but for purposes of
more detailed organisation and administration
additional departments were created which exercised
direct jurisdiction over their respective fleets.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
The principal of these was known as the "Auxiliary
Patrol Office," under the Fourth Sea Lord and
the Department of the Director of Minesweeping.
These formed a part of the General Staff&mdash;if a
military term is permissible&mdash;and both issued
official publications periodically throughout the
war, which served to keep the staffs of all the
different war bases and the commanding officers
of the thousands of ships informed as to current
movements and ruses of the enemy.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to detail more closely the work
of these departments, especially as much has yet
to be said before plunging into the maelstrom
of war. A sufficient indication of the colossal
nature of the work they were called upon to perform
will be found in a moment's reflection of
what the administration and control of such a
large and nondescript fleet, spread over the world&mdash;from
the White Sea to the East Indies&mdash;must
have meant to the small staff allowed by the
exigencies of an unparalleled war.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Officers and Men</span></div>

<p>The greatest problem in modern naval war is,
undoubtedly, the supply of trained men. For
this reason it has been left to the last to describe
how the difficulty was faced and overcome by
England and her oversea Dominions in 1914.</p>

<p>Before doing so, however, it may be of interest
to give here a few extracts from an excellent little
official publication, showing how the British fleet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
was manned and expanded in bygone days of
national peril<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In time of war there has always been an intimate
connection between the Royal Navy and the
Merchant Service. Latterly, and more especially
since the Russian War of 1854 to 1856, this fact
tended to be forgotten, partly because men-of-war
developed on particular lines and became far more
unlike merchantmen than they had ever been
before, and also because, by the introduction of
continuous service, the personnel of the Navy
seemed to have developed into a separate caste,
distinguished by its associations, traditions and
<i>esprit de corps</i>, as much by its special training and
qualifications, from other seafaring men. This
war has proved once again, to such as needed proof,
that the two services cannot exist without each
other, and that the Sea Power of the Empire is not
its naval strength alone, but its maritime strength.
Even at the risk of insisting on the obvious, it is
necessary to repeat that, for an Island Empire, a
war at sea cannot be won merely by the naval
action which defeats the enemy; naval successes
are of value for the fruit they bear, the chief of
which is the power that they give to the victor to
maintain his own sea-borne trade and to interrupt
that of the enemy.</p>

<p>"An elementary way of looking at the problems
of manning the Royal Navy and the Merchant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Service is to consider that there is in the country a
common stock of seamen, on which both can draw.
But this theory, like many others equally obvious
and tempting, has the disadvantage that it leaves
important factors out of account and, if worked
out, results in an absurdity. Thus, shortly before
war began there were in the country some 420,000
seamen, of whom one-third were in the Navy and
two-thirds engaged in merchant ships and fishing
vessels. There was no considerable body of unemployed
seamen. During the war the personnel
of the Navy was expanded to something like the
420,000 which represents the common stock of seamen.
Therefore, if the theory met the case, there
would have been no men left for the Merchant
Service. But the merchant ships, in spite of
difficulty and danger, continued to run, employing
great numbers of men. And we must not forget
to take into account the number of men, amounting
to 48,000 killed and 4500 prisoners of war, who
have been lost in the two services during the war.
So it comes to this, that the common stock of seamen,
or at least of men fit to man ships, has expanded
during the war by more than 50 per cent.
Whence came these extra men? Clearly for the
most part from the non-seafaring classes.</p>

<p>"The Navy in November, 1918, employed some
80,000 officers and men from the Merchant Service&mdash;viz.
20,000 R.N.R. ratings, 36,000 Trawler
Reserve, and 20,000 mercantile seamen and firemen
on Transport agreements, plus the officers.
If the supposition, made in the absence of statistics,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
is correct that at this time the number of men in
the Merchant Service itself had decreased proportionately
to the loss of tonnage, it would seem that
the Merchant Service needed no considerable inflow
of men during the war. In other words, most
of those added to the stock of seamen during the
war must have gone into the Navy. This corresponds
with known fact: the Navy has, in addition
to the Reserve men already mentioned, nearly
200,000 men to demobilise in order to put its personnel
on the footing on which it stood when war
broke out.</p>

<p>"It will be of interest to see how the personnel
of the Navy expanded in former wars, and how at
the peace it was invariably reduced to something
like its pre-war figures. This can readily be done
in tabular form:</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It appears at once from these figures that the
naval expansion during earlier wars was in most
cases much greater proportionately than it has been
in this. Roughly the personnel in this war has
been multiplied by three; in earlier wars it was
increased six, seven, eight, or even nine fold, if we
take the difference between the figures for 1792
and 1812.</p>

<p>"It is a common error to suppose that our ships
in the old wars were manned entirely by seamen.
A knowledge of how the men were raised shows
that this cannot have been so; and confirmation
can be had from a very brief study of ships' muster
books. Only about a third of the crew of a line-of-battle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
ship were, in the seaman's phrase, 'prime
seamen.' The rest were either only partly trained
or were frankly not sailor men. The <i>Victory</i> at
Trafalgar was not an ill-manned ship&mdash;here is an
analysis of her crew: officers, commissioned and
warrant, 28; petty officers, including marines,
63; able seamen, 213; ordinary seamen and
boys, 225; landsmen, 86; marines, 137; artificers,
18; quarter gunners, 12; supernumeraries and
domestics, 37.</p>

<p>"During the whole of our naval history down to
1815 it was the invariable rule that in peace time
the battle fleets were laid up unmanned, and only
enough ships were kept in commission to 'show
the flag' and to police the sea. This accounts for
the very large increase of the naval personnel
which immediately became necessary when there
was a threat of war; and it accounts also for
the difficulty which was always experienced in
raising the men. This difficulty was even greater
than we are apt to suppose, for the Merchant
Service has never been able to give the navy more
than a fraction of the total number of men
needed, and the machinery for raising extra men
has, until this war, always been of a most primitive
nature.</p>

<p>"When war came the ships were commissioned,
without crews. This could be done because from
the latter part of the seventeenth century there was
a permanent force of officers. Then the officers
had to find their own crews. They began by drawing
their proportion of marines, and then proceeded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
to invite seamen to volunteer. In this way they
got a number of skilled seamen, men who had been
in the navy before, and came back to it either as
petty officers or in the hope of becoming so. Then
warrants to impress seamen would be issued.
Theoretically the impress was merely a form of
conscription, the Crown claiming by prerogative
the right to the services of its seafaring subjects.
Practically a good deal of violence was at times
necessary, as many of the men, preferring to sail in
merchant ships, or wishing to wait for a proclamation
of bounty, tried to avoid arrest. The scuffles
that took place on these occasions gave the impress
service a bad name, not altogether deserved, for
real efforts were made to avoid hardship, and in
any case the number of men raised in this way
was greatly exaggerated by popular report."</p></div>

<p>There was no compulsion during the Great War
to join any unit of the British fleet. Therefore
all were either in the regular service, reservists
or volunteers. The need was made known not
only throughout the British Isles, but also from
Vancouver to Cape Town, Sydney and Wellington,
and men in all walks of life, but with either the
<i>Wander-Lust</i> or true love of the wide open sea in
their blood, rallied from all parts of the far-flung
Empire to the call of the White Ensign.</p>

<p>In order to obtain some 6000 officers and nearly
200,000 trained or semi-trained men, new sources
of supply had to be tapped. Already the great
battle fleets, brought up to full war strength and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
with adequate reserves, had absorbed nearly all
the Reserve officers who could be spared from the
food and troop transports.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class='attrib'><i>British Official Photograph</i></div><span class="caption">A Large and Heavily armed German Submarine of the Cruiser Type</span>
</div>

<p>First came the great sea-training establishment
of the Empire&mdash;the Mercantile Marine and its
retired officers and men&mdash;already heavily depleted.
Then the yacht clubs from the Fraser to the
Thames and Clyde. Thousands of professionals
and amateurs came overseas to the training
cruisers and the "naval university," Canada alone
supplying several hundred officers.</p>

<p>Doctors came from the hospitals and from
lucrative private practices. The engineering professions
and trades supplied the technical staffs
and skilled mechanics. The great banks and city
offices yielded the accountants, and the fishing and
pleasure-boating communities, not only of Great
Britain, but also of the Dominions and Colonies,
yielded the men in tens of thousands. In this way
the personnel of the new navy was completed in a
very few months.</p>

<p>Before passing on to describe, in the detail of
personal acquaintance, the severe training of this
naval force, a general knowledge of its heterogeneous
character is necessary to enable the reader
to understand this great assemblage of the sons of
the Empire.</p>




<p>In the smoke-filled wardroom and gunroom
of the training cruiser, H.M.S. <i>Hermione</i> one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
windy March evening in 1916 there were some
eighty officers of the auxiliary fleet, and of this
number one hailed from distant Rhodesia, where
he was the owner of thousands of acres of land and
a goodly herd of cattle, but who, some time in the
past, had rounded the Horn in a <i>wind-jammer</i> and
taken <i>sights</i> in the "Roaring Forties." Another
was a seascape painter of renown both in England
and the United States. A third was a member of
a Pacific coast yacht club. A fourth was the son of
an Irish peer, the owner of a steam yacht. Then
came a London journalist, a barrister, a solicitor
and a New Zealand yachtsman, while sitting at
the table was a famous traveller and a <i>pukka</i>
commander.</p>

<p>In the neighbouring gunroom, among the crowd
of sub-lieutenants&mdash;all of the same great force, the
Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve&mdash;was a grey-haired
veteran from the Canadian Lakes, a
youngster from the Clyde, the son of a shipowner
from Australia and a bronzed mine manager from
the Witwatersrand.</p>

<p>Among the engineers and mechanics the same
diversity. Men from several of the great engineering
establishments, a student from a North
Country university, electrical engineers from the
power stations and mechanics from the bench,
with here and there one or two with sea-going
experience.</p>

<p>In the forecastle and elsewhere about the old
cruiser&mdash;now merely a training establishment&mdash;were
sailors with years of experience in both sail<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and steam. Fishermen from the Hebrides and
Newfoundland rubbing shoulders with yacht
hands from the Solent and Clyde.</p>

<p>From this curiously mixed but excellent raw
material a naval personnel, with its essential knowledge
and discipline, had to be fashioned in record
time by an incredibly small staff of commissioned
and warrant officers of the permanent service,
aided by the more experienced amateurs.</p>

<p>It must, however, not be thought from this that
the amateur was converted into a professional seaman
in the space of a week or two. Three months
of specialised training enabled them to take their
place in the new fleet, but with some it required a
much longer period to enable them to feel that
perfect self-confidence when <i>alone</i> in the face of
difficulties and dangers which is the true heritage
of the sea.</p>

<p>To describe here the training of officers and men
would be to repeat what will be more fully and
personally described in succeeding chapters. It is
sufficient to say that the aim was to bring them all
to a predetermined standard of efficiency, which
would enable the officers to command ships of
specific types at sea and in action, and the men to
form efficient engineers and deck hands for almost
any ship in the Navy.</p>

<p>The medical branches naturally required no
special training and the accountants merely a
knowledge of naval systems of financial and
general administration. These two branches had
their own training establishments.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>When the period of preliminary training in the
cruiser <i>Hermione</i> was over the officers were passed
on to the Royal Naval College at Greenwich, and
from there to one or other of the fifty war bases in
the United Kingdom, the Mediterranean or farther
afield. Their appointments were to ships forming
the fleets attached to each of these bases and
generally operating in the surrounding seas.</p>

<p>In this way the whole zone of war was covered
by an anti-submarine and minesweeping organisation
and general naval patrol, which operated in
conjunction with, but separate from, the battle
fleets, squadrons and flotillas, which were thus left
free to perform their true functions in big naval
engagements.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE NEW NAVY&mdash;TRAINING AN
ANTI-SUBMARINE FORCE</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Having</span> described the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> of the new
navy, and how it became a fleet in being, with its
own admirals, captains, staffs, bases and all the
paraphernalia of war, I can pass on to a more
intimate description of the training of the officers
and men, preparatory to their being drafted to the
scattered units of this great anti-submarine force.</div>

<p>Lying in the spacious docks at Southampton
was the old 4000-ton cruiser <i>Hermione</i>, which had
been brought round from her natural base in
Portsmouth dockyard to act as the depot ship and
training establishment for a large section of this
new force. Not all the officers and men of the
auxiliary fleet were, however, destined to pass
across its decks. This vessel was reserved for
the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, from which
a very considerable proportion of the entire personnel
of the new fleet was drawn. Nor was
H.M.S. <i>Hermione</i> the first depot ship of the war-time
R.N.V.R. at Southampton, for the Admiralty
yacht <i>Resource II.</i> had been used for the
first few drafts, but was unfortunately burned to
the water's edge. There were also other vessels
and establishments at Portsmouth, Devonport and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Chatham. These were, however, mainly for the
reception and brief training of the more experienced
Merchant Service officers, entered in the
Royal Naval Reserve for the duration of the war,
and for the surgeons and accountants.</p>

<p>The men of the new force were mostly trained
in the naval barracks and depot ships situated at
the big naval centres, such as Portsmouth and
Chatham. After a few weeks all these establishments
were drafting, in a constant stream, the
trained human element to the vessels awaiting full
complements at the different war bases, or being
constructed in the hundreds of shipyards of the
Empire.</p>

<p>About H.M.S. <i>Hermione</i>, which has been selected
as being representative of the training depots of a
large section of the auxiliary service, little need be
said, beyond the fact that she was commanded,
first, by a distinguished officer from the Dardanelles,
and subsequently by an equally capable
officer, who, by the irony of fate, had in pre-war
times been a member of the British Naval Mission
to the Turkish navy&mdash;both of them men whose
experience and unfailing tact contributed largely
to the success of the thousands of embryo officers
trained under their command.</p>

<p>The ship herself was a rambling old cruiser,
but very little of the actual training was carried
out on board. Spacious buildings on the quayside
provided the training grounds for gunnery,
drill, signalling, engineering and all the complicated
curricula, of which more anon. Lying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
in the still waters of the dock, alongside the comparatively
big grey cruiser, were the trim little
hulls of a numerous flotilla of 20-knot motor
launches, newly arrived from Canada, with wicked-looking
13-pounder high-angle guns, stumpy
torpedo-boat masts and brand-new White Ensigns
and brass-bound decks. These were the advance
guard of a fleet of over 500 similar craft, to the
command of which many of the officers being
trained would, after a period of practical experience
at sea, eventually succeed.</p>

<p>There were besides numerous other mosquito
craft, which throbbed in and out of the dock from
that vast sheltered arm of the sea called <i>Southampton
Water</i> on mysterious errands, soon to be
solved by new recruits in the chilly winds of
winter nights and early mornings.</p>

<p>This, then, was the mother ship and her children.
When once the aft gangway leading up from the
dockside to the clean-scrubbed decks had been
crossed, and the sentry's challenge answered, the
embryo officer left civilian life behind and commenced
his training for the stern work of war.</p>

<p>It may not be out of place to give here a closer
description of the training of the officers and men
of the new navy, drawn from personal experience.
To do this without the irritating egoism of the
personal narrative it will be necessary, as often
in future pages, to adopt the convenient "third
person."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The night was fine, but a keen March wind blew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
from off the sea. The dock lights were reflected
in the still waters of the harbour. Tall cranes
stood out black and clearly defined against the
cold night sky. The shadows were deep around
the warehouses, stores and other buildings of the
busy dockside.</p>

<p>Lying in the south-western basin was the big
grey hull of the cruiser, newly painted, and looking
very formidable, with its tall masts and fighting-tops
towering into the blue void, and its massive
bow rising high above the dock wall.</p>

<p>Coming from the darkness on board were the
tinkling notes of a banjo and the subdued hum of
voices. Then the loud call of the quartermaster
and the ringing of eight bells.</p>

<p>A group of newly appointed officers picked their
way carefully among the tangled mooring ropes on
the quayside and as they approached the warship
were duly challenged by the sentries. Two
of them had only just arrived from distant New
Zealand. They were all "for training," and on
mounting the quarterdeck gangway were politely
requested by the smiling quartermaster to report
at the ship's office.</p>

<p>In order to get from the deck to this abode of
paymasters and writers, except by the tabooed
"captain's hatchway," there had to be negotiated
a long passage leading past the wardroom and the
gunroom. In normal times at such an hour
this passage would probably have been almost
deserted, with the exception of a sentry, but the
training was being speeded up to meet the demands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
of war, and with nearly 200 officers, many of whom
fortunately lived ashore, constantly moving to
and fro, it became either a semi-dark, congested
thoroughfare, in which everyone was curtly apologising
for knocking against someone else, or else it
contained the steady pressure of a gunroom overflow
meeting, with a tobacco-scented atmosphere
peculiarly its own.</p>

<p>When the formality of reporting arrival had
been completed, the embryo officers were taken in
tow by the "Officer of the Day," whose duty it was
to introduce them to the gunroom and make them
familiar in a general way with the routine of the
ship. The officer who performed this ceremony
on the night in question has since held a highly
responsible post at the Admiralty&mdash;such is the
fortune of war.</p>

<p>The first shock came when the work for the
following day was explained. It commenced with
physical drill on the quayside at 7 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> and ended
with instruction in signalling at 6 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>!</p>

<div class='center'><b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</b></div>

<p>The early morning was bitterly cold but fine.
Physical "jerks" was not a dress parade; in fact,
some of the early risers on the surrounding transports
and ocean mail boats must have wondered
what particular form of mania the crowd of
running, leaping and arm-swinging men, in all
stages of undress on the quayside, really suffered
from.</p>

<p>Breakfast and Divisions were the next items on
the programme, and the new-comers looked forward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
to the day's work with the keen interest of
freshness.</p>

<p><i>Morning Divisions</i> and <i>Evening Quarters</i> are
events of some importance in the daily routine of
his Majesty's ships. They are parades of the entire
ship's company, with the exception of those on
important duty, marking the beginning and end of
the day's work. The crew, or men under training,
are mustered in "Watches," under their respective
officers, and stand to attention at the bugle call.
The senior officer taking divisions then enters, a
roll is called and the names of those absent reported.
The chaplain stands between the lines of
men; the order "Off caps!" is given and prayers
commence. When these are finished certain orders
of the day are read out to the assembled ship's
company and the parade is over.</p>

<p>At evening quarters, on certain days in the week,
the names were read out of the officers and men
detailed for special duties or for draft to a zone of
war.</p>

<p>When morning divisions were over the day's
work began. The embryo officers were attached
to the seamanship class, consisting of about twenty
men of all ages. Oilskins were donned, for the sky
was overcast and the wind keen. They climbed
down the steel sides of the cruiser on to the small
deck of a tender, which was to convey them out on
to the broad but sheltered waters where much of
the preliminary practical training was to take place
during the following weeks.</p>

<p>The instructor, an officer attached for the purpose,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
then divided his class into two "watches,"
one being directed to work out the proposed course
of the ship on the charts in the cabin and to give
the necessary orders to the other watch on deck,
who were to carry them into effect as the ship
steamed along, with the aid of sextant, compass,
wheel, engine-room telegraph, lead and log-line.
As all possessed some knowledge of the sea, and had
experience in navigating, this work did not prove
as difficult as it undoubtedly would to anyone
entirely devoid of nautical knowledge.</p>

<p>Those in the cabin with the charts worked out
the compass courses from one point to another,
making the necessary allowances for tide, deviation,
etc. Others of the same watch received
reports from the "bridge" and made the correct
entries in the log-book. All elementary work, but
which needed practice to make perfect, and on the
accuracy of which men's lives would depend in the
very near future.</p>

<p>The watch on deck was engaged in the more
practical work of coastal navigation and could see
the effect of any mistake made theoretically by
their companions below. At midday the watches
were reversed. Those working at the charts and
courses came on deck and the seamen of the
morning became the navigating officers of the
afternoon.</p>

<p>On this particular day the second or port watch
had the worst of it. A squally wind and rain had
set in, making the work on deck thoroughly wet
and uncomfortable. An hour or so later the small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
ship was rolling and pitching and everyone was
drenched. The lead was kept going by hands
numb with cold&mdash;a foretaste of the long and bitter
days and nights to be afterwards spent in wintry
seas.</p>

<p>The training cruises were continued for many
days and were interspersed with lectures on the
elements of good seamanship, the more advanced
theory and practice of navigation being left for a
later course at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich.</p>

<p>After seamanship came gunnery. Each of the
different types of heavy but finely made weapons
had to be learned in detail&mdash;a feat of memory
when it came to the watch-like mechanism of the
Maxim. Guns were disabled and had to be put
right. They missed fire and were made by the
instructors&mdash;old naval gunners&mdash;to play every
dastardly trick conceivable. The final test which
had to be successfully passed was the dismantling
of each type of gun used in the auxiliary fleet and
the reassembling of it.</p>

<p>With gunnery came also the marks and uses of
the different kinds of ammunition, the systems
of "spotting" and "range-finding." Every gun
had its officer crew and the rapidity of fire was
recorded. Each man in turn was chosen to give
the necessary orders and to judge the ranges and
deflections. In this way not only was the practical
work learned by heart, but also the theory of naval
gunnery, so far as it related to the smaller types of
weapon.</p>

<p>The use of the depth charge, both mechanically<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
and tactically, was expounded and practically
demonstrated, together with that of the torpedo,
the mine, mine laying and sweeping, and the
peculiarities of various explosives. Rifle and
revolver practice was encouraged, and morse and
semaphore signalling formed part of the daily
routine.</p>

<p>The training was not entirely preparatory for
work afloat. Squad and company drill, rifle and
bayonet exercise, and man[oe]uvring in extended
order formed a part of the comprehensive training.
One day, not many weeks after their arrival, the
officers whose fortunes have been followed found
themselves shouting orders and directing by arm
and whistle lines of dusty <i>camarades</i> advancing
over a common in the most approved military
fashion.</p>

<p>The training was not all hard work. The gathering
of so many men from all quarters of the world,
with a wealth of experience and adventure behind
them, was in itself a source of mutual interest&mdash;and
incidentally an education in modern British
Imperialism. Scarcely any part of the world
went for long unrepresented in either the wardroom
or gunroom of the old cruiser <i>Hermione</i> in
those days of war, and many were the yarns told
of Alaska days, hunting in Africa, experiences in
remote corners of North America, pearling in the
Pacific and life on the Indian frontier, to say
nothing of wild nights on the seven seas. Grey
heads and round, boyish faces, the university and
the frontier, with a camaraderie seldom equalled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>The period of training in the old cruiser was
drawing to a close when each officer was appointed
to "Boat Duty." There were five launches on
duty at a time, and their crews had to be instantly
ready day and night. The most coveted were the
two 21-knot boats, used almost exclusively for the
conveyance of pilots to and from the hospital
ships and transports. Then came the patrol boat,
a slow old tub with a comfortable cabin, and work
out on Southampton Water at night. The three
"duty boats" were for emergency use and were
held at the disposal of the naval transport officer.</p>

<p>The duties on each boat varied and were in the
nature of training. The pilot boat was required to
lie alongside the cutter, out beyond the harbour,
and to convey the pilots at high speed to and from
the stream of shipping. It was a pleasant duty
which entailed alternate nights in the generous,
breezy company of the old sea-dogs of the cutter,
with occasional races at half-a-mile a minute
through the darkness and spray to the moving
leviathans of the ocean.</p>

<p>The patrol ambled up and down the sheltered
waterways during the day and night, examining
the "permits" of fishermen and preventing the
movement of small craft during the hours of darkness,
when the long lines of troop-ships were
leaving for France.</p>

<p>The work of the duty boats varied from day to
day, but there was always the morning and evening
mail to be collected from and delivered to the
ships of the auxiliary fleet lying out in the fair-way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>When this spell of water-police work was over
there came a few days' practice in the handling of
the fast sea-going patrol launches, or "M.L.'s,"
about which so much has since been written in the
daily papers.</p>

<p>After the cramming received in the lecture-rooms,
the arduous drill and the somewhat monotonous
work on the slow-moving tenders, the runs seaward
on these new and trim little vessels, the
man[oe]uvring at nineteen knots, the breeze of
passage and the feeling of controlled power acted
as an elixir on both mind and body. Then came
firing practice in the open sea. The sharp crack
of cordite, the tongues of livid flame, the scream of
the shells, the white splashes of the ricochet and
the salt sea breezes.</p>

<p>Two days later the preliminary training was
over and there loomed ahead a period of hard
study at the Royal Naval College.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>A NAVAL UNIVERSITY IN TIME OF WAR</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Built</span> by King Charles I. for the Stuart navy,
and used for over two and a half centuries
as the university of the Senior Service, the
Royal Naval College, Greenwich, is a building
with an historic past. It has housed, fed and
taught many of England's most illustrious
sailors.</div>

<p>It was to cabin and lecture hall in this fine old
building that officers of the new navy went to complete
their knowledge of navigation and kindred
subjects when their preliminary sea training came
to a close.</p>

<p>There is but little romance in a highly specialised
course of study designed to enable the recipients
to find their way with safety, both in sunshine and
storm, over the vast water surface of the world.
To describe here the subjects taught would only
be wearisome and uninteresting. Sufficient to say
that the course was a most comprehensive one and
admirably arranged by masters of the mariner's
art. If any fault can be found it is certainly not
one of paucity of information, and the proof of its
efficacy can be found in the fact that, so far as the
author knows, there was not a single ship, afterwards
commanded by officers who underwent this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
training, lost through insufficient knowledge of
the art of navigation.</p>

<p>The days spent in the Naval College were fully
occupied by attendance at lectures and the evenings
in private study and the preparation of elaborate
notes and sketches for the final passing-out
examination. There was one moment of each day
which was rendered historic by old custom. It
came at the conclusion of dinner in the big white
hall, when the officer whose turn it happened to be
rose to his feet and gave the toast of the navy&mdash;"Gentlemen,
the King!"</p>

<p>It was in the grounds of this college that many
officers saw their first zeppelin raid. On one occasion
it occurred late in the fourth week of the
course. Nearly all were in their respective studies,
surrounded by a mass of papers, charts, drawing
instruments and books, making the last determined
attack on various knotty problems previous
to the final examination.</p>

<p>Ten <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> had just been registered by the electric
clocks in the famous observatory overlooking the
college, when the sound of running feet came down
the long corridors. A stentorian voice shouted:
"All lights out!"</p>

<p>In a moment the whole building, with its labyrinth
of corridors, was plunged into Ethiopian
darkness. Doors were opened and a jostling
crowd of men groped their way down passages
and stone staircases into the grounds. Here the
Admiral and his staff were making sure that
no lights were visible. Traffic in the near-by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
thoroughfare had been stopped, and all around lay
the Great Metropolis, oppressively dark and still.</p>

<p>A searchlight flashed heavenwards and was
followed by other beams. All of these suddenly
concentrated on the gleaming white hull of a
zeppelin, high in the indigo sky. The ground
trembled under the fire of the anti-aircraft
batteries. Shells whistled and moaned over the
College and bright flashes came from little puffs
of white smoke high in the central blue.</p>

<p>Dull-sounding but earth-shaking booms came
from different points as the airship dropped her
deadly cargo. Shrapnel fell on the congested
house-tops with a peculiar hiss and thud and
ambulances rumbled over the stone-paved high-road.</p>

<p>It was a small incident and scarcely worth the
space required for its recording, but it served a
purpose&mdash;to steel the heart and steady the hand
for the time to come.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>THE NEW FLEETS IN BEING</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Back</span> once again on the old cruiser with training
completed and awaiting draft to the zones of war.
Then came the sailing orders. The name of each
officer was called in turn and he disappeared into
the ship's office, to return a few minutes later carrying
a sheaf of white and blue Admiralty orders,
his face grave or gay according to destination.</div>

<p>Some were for the Spanish Main and bemoaned
their fate at being ordered to a station so remote
from the principal zone of war. Others were
destined for the Mediterranean and comforted
themselves with hopes that trouble was brewing
elsewhere than in the Adriatic, to which a lucky
few were appointed. The Suez Canal and Egypt
claimed their share, but by far the greater number
were bound for the misty northern seas.</p>

<p>About the training given to the 200,000 men
little can be said here because of its diversity.
They came as volunteers from all quarters of the
globe, were collected at the great depots in Portsmouth,
Chatham and Devonport, were trained in
the art of signalling, squad drill, gunnery, seamanship
and the hundred and one things required by
the "handy man," then belched forth into the
ships.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Some had sailed the sea for years before in vessels
of all kinds and needed little more than the sense
of cohesion and unquestioning obedience imparted
by discipline and drill. Others knew more of the
working of a loom, or the extraction of coal, than
of seamanship, and spent a cheerful but arduous
few months in training depots and on special ships
completing their education. Cooks there were
who could make little else besides Scotch broth,
while others, the engineers&mdash;or motor mechanics,
as they were called when appointed to some of the
petrol-driven patrol boats&mdash;knew their profession
or trade better than they could be taught, and
proved themselves untiring and indomitable when
it came to the real thing&mdash;as will be seen later.</p>

<p>Having now described the training of both
officers and men, we come to the ships they were
called upon to navigate down to the seas of
adventure.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Armed Liners</span></div>

<p>To set on record the formation of the ships of
the new navy in divisions, squadrons or units, and
to classify them here under separate headings&mdash;an
easy enough matter with regular fleets constructed
for definite duties&mdash;is a task of considerable difficulty
with a heterogeneous fleet composed of
several thousand vessels with seldom two alike.</p>

<p>Beginning with the ocean liners, as the largest
and most powerfully armed of the new fleet: these
were mostly grouped for administrative purposes
in one large formation, known as the "Tenth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Cruiser Squadron." But when at sea they operated
in smaller units and frequently as single ship
patrols. Their principal zone of activity was the
vast stretch of Arctic sea extending from Norway
and North Russia to Iceland, the Hebrides and
Labrador. Their work was arduous in the extreme,
as will easily be realised from the nature of the
seas in which they primarily operated.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, were distinct divisions possible,
the Tenth Cruiser Squadron did not form part of
the auxiliary navy in its true sense, although many
of the officers and men were drawn from newly
raised corps. It acted rather as a distinct patrol
fleet, filling the wide gap of sea between Scotland
and the Arctic ice.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Fighting Sloops</span></div>

<p>Next in order of importance came the newly
built screw sloops, with powerful guns and engines.
Their numbers varied and they were continually
being added to. Some of these vessels were used
for patrol duties and others for minesweeping.
The sloop flotillas had many zones of activity.
One was the North Atlantic, with special care for
the coast of Ireland. Another was the North Sea,
with a marked preference for the east coast of
Scotland and the Straits of Dover.</p>

<p>These flotillas also were frequently assigned
duties independent of the auxiliary patrol organisation,
but nevertheless formed an important part
of the vast anti-submarine and anti-mine navy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Mediterranean also there were a number
of patrol gunboats and minesweepers similar to the
fighting sloops. Their principal base in this region
was on Italian soil.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Armed Yachts</span></div>

<p>We now come to that portion of the auxiliary
fleet whose special care was the seas around the
United Kingdom and the Colonies. First came
the armed yachts, over 50 in number, with tonnages
varying from one to five hundred. These
were obtained from the owners, armed as heavily
as their size and strength permitted, and mostly
became the flag-ships of patrol flotillas. They
were nearly always equipped with wireless, hydrophone
listening apparatus, depth charges and all
the appliances for anti-submarine warfare.</p>

<p>Their losses were not heavy considering the
dangerous nature of their work and could almost
be counted on the fingers of both hands. This
was due mainly to their good speed and man[oe]uvring
qualities. They made wonderfully efficient
auxiliary warships, maintaining the sea in
almost all weathers and accounting for quite a
number of U-boats. These vessels were, of course,
never used for the rougher work of minesweeping.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Whalers</span></div>

<p>The whalers were few in number and resembled
small destroyers. They were powerful craft and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
well armed, but their sea-keeping qualities left
much to be desired. In fact, to use a naval term,
they were dirty boats even in a "lop." It was
said that if an officer or man had been for long in
one of these ships he was proof against all forms of
sea-sickness. A big assertion, as even old sailors
will admit&mdash;but they call it "liver."</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Minesweepers</span></div>

<p>About the screw and paddle minesweepers little
can be said beyond the fact that they numbered
about 200 and performed some of the most dangerous
work in the war. Many of them were old
passenger steamers from the Clyde, Bristol Channel,
Thames and south and east coast resorts, the
famous <i>Brighton Queen</i> being, until her untimely
end on a mine off the Belgian coast, one of their
number. The loss among this class of ship was
about 10 per cent.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Trawlers</span></div>

<p>By far the largest portion of the auxiliary patrol
units consisted of armed and commissioned
trawlers. Their numbers far exceeded 1000, and
nearly half were used for the dangerous work
of minesweeping. About a trawler little need be
said, for beyond what can be seen in the accompanying
illustrations there is little of interest until
we come to the question of their curious arms and
appliances, fit subjects for a special chapter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>A large number of these units were fitted with
wireless and carried masked batteries of quick-firing
guns. To give here their zones of operation
would be to set out in detail not only the seas
around the British Isles, but distant waters such
as the Mediterranean and the White Sea. They had
distinct duties to perform, which may be summed
up as follows:&mdash;(1) minesweeping; (2) night and
day patrols alone or in company over immense
areas of sea; (3) convoy duty; and (4) fishery
guard.</p>

<p>Their losses were heavy, both in ships and men,
amounting to about 30 per cent. Many were the
lonely sea fights engaged in by these vessels. A
few will receive the praise they deserve and the
remainder will rest content with the knowledge
of duty done.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Drifters</span></div>

<p>If numbers or losses were the dominant factors
the armed drifters should be high in the list.
There were engaged considerably over 1000 of
these craft, and the losses amounted to about
20 per cent.</p>

<p>It may be necessary to inform some of my readers
that a drifter is not necessarily a vessel that is content
to start out on a voyage and rely on <i>drifting</i>
to its destination, as its name implies. The term
is derived from the drift nets used by these vessels
for fishing in time of peace. They are, in almost
all respects, small editions of the deep-sea trawler&mdash;<i>minus</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the powerful steam-driven winch for hauling
in the trawl nets.</p>

<span class="caption">Some of the 550 Motor Launch Hulls being constructed on the Banks of the St. Lawrence River, Canada</span>
</div>


<p>For war purposes the holds of these, and many
other types of auxiliary warships, were converted
into officers' cabins, or gun platforms for masked
batteries. A few carried special nets in which to
entangle the wily "Fritz." Others had aboard
special types of submarine mines, and one, commanded
by the author, was used for the transport
of wounded from Admiral Sir David Beatty's
flag-ship, H.M.S. <i>Lion</i>, after the Jutland fight.</p>

<p>These were, as might be expected, good sea boats,
and carried out duties of great danger and value.
Several hundred were fitted with wireless. Their
zone of operations was far flung, extending from
the Arctic Circle to the Equator. It was, however,
in the unequal fights with German destroyers in
the Straits of Dover and with Austrian torpedo
boat destroyers in the Adriatic that they made a
name for valour. In two of these engagements
no less than six and fourteen drifters were sunk in
a few minutes.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Motor Launches</span></div>

<p>About the now famous motor launches, or
"movies," as they are called in the Service,
much will be said in later pages. They numbered
over 500, and, with but few exceptions, were a
homogeneous flotilla of fast sea-going patrol boats,
heavily armed for their size. Some idea of their
appearance under varying conditions will be gained
from a study of the illustrations.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>They were all commanded by R.N.V.R. officers,
whose training on H.M.S. <i>Hermione</i> and elsewhere
has been described in an earlier chapter. They
carried a crew of nine men and two officers, and
their zones of operations extended from the icy
seas which wash the Orkneys and Shetlands to the
West Indies and the Suez Canal.</p>

<p>It may be of interest to give here an extract from
the American journal, <i>Rudder</i>, showing how these
vessels came into being.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Although the hulls were
constructed in Canada, and much of the assembling
was also carried out on the banks of the St Lawrence,
the engines came from the United States.
It was to the organising ability of Mr Henry R.
Sutphen, of the Electric Boat Company, New
York, that the delivery of over 500 of these
wonderful little craft in less than a year was
due. Here is that gentleman's story of the
"M.L." contract:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It was in February, 1915, that we had our
initial negotiations with the British Naval authorities.
A well-known English shipbuilder and
ordnance expert was in this country, presumably
on secret business for the Admiralty, and I met
him one afternoon at his hotel. Naturally the
menace of the German submarine warfare came
into discussion; we both agreed that the danger
was a real one, and that steps should be taken to
meet it.</p>

<p>"I suggested the use of a number of small,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
speedy gasolene boats for use in attacking and
destroying submarines. My idea was to have a
mosquito fleet big enough to thoroughly patrol
the coastal waters of Great Britain, each of them
carrying a 13-lb. rapid-fire gun.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I explained that I had in mind two distinct
types. The first would have an over-all length of
about 50 feet, and would be fitted with high-speed
engines; such a boat would show a maximum of
25 knots. The alternative would be something
around 80 feet in length, with slow turning engines<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
and a speed of 19 knots. I added that my preference
was for the larger and slower type.</p>

<p>"He asked how many units of that class we could
build in a year's time, and I told him that I could
guarantee fifty. He said that he would think the
matter over, and we parted.</p>

<p>"A few days later I had another interview and
was told that the British Government was ready to
give us a contract for fifty vessels of the larger type,
the whole lot to be delivered within a year's time.</p>

<p>"On April 9th, 1915, the contract for fifty
'chasers' was signed.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The <i>Lusitania</i> sailed on her last voyage May
1st, 1915, and a week later her torpedoing by a
German U-boat was reported. My English friend
was sailing that same day from New York, and we
were giving him a farewell luncheon at Delmonico's.
When the appalling news was communicated to
him he appeared much depressed, as indeed was
natural enough, and also very thoughtful. Before
he said good-bye he intimated to me that he intended
advising the Admiralty to increase the
number of 'Chasers'; he asked me if I thought I
could take care of a bigger order. I told him that
I could guarantee to build a boat a day for so long
a period as the Admiralty might care to name.</p>

<p>"After he reached England we shortly received
a cablegram ordering five hundred additional
'Sutphens,' our code word for submarine 'Chaser';
in other words we were now asked to build five

<p>The armament of a motor launch consisted of
a 13-pounder quick-firing high-angle gun, capable
of throwing a lyddite shell for over four miles,
and was as useful against aircraft as it was against
submarines. In addition to this heavy gun for
small craft they carried about 1200 lb. of high
explosive in the form of depth charges for bombing
under-water craft, a Lewis machine gun, rifles
and revolvers.</p>

<p>These vessels were driven by twin screws connected
to twin engines of about 500 h.p. They
possessed, in addition, an auxiliary petrol engine
of about 60 h.p. for compressing the air required
to start the main engines, for working the fire and
bilge pumps, and for driving a dynamo to recharge
the electric storage batteries. The triple tanks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
carried over 3000 gallons of petrol, and the consumption,
when travelling at full speed, was a
gallon a minute.</p>

<p>Many were fitted with wireless, and all of them
had on board the most approved pattern of hydrophone,
with which to listen below the surface for
the movements of hostile submarines. They had
electric light in the cabins and for navigation,
fighting and mast-head signalling purposes. A
moderately powerful searchlight, fitted with a
Morse signalling shutter, was also part of their
equipment.</p>

<p>These little miniature warships possessed a small
wardroom and sleeping cabin for the officers, a
galley with petrol range for cooking, an engine-room,
magazine for the ammunition, chart-room,
and ample forecastle accommodation for the crew
of nine men. All parts of the ship were connected
with the bridge by speaking-tubes and electric
bells, and the aft deck accommodated a steel
life-boat.</p>

<p>The duties of these craft varied considerably.
For over three years they maintained a constant
patrol in the North Sea, Atlantic, English Channel,
Irish Sea, Mediterranean, Adriatic, Suez Canal,
Straits of Gibraltar, and in West Indian waters.
Only one who knows by experience can fully
appreciate what work in these northern seas, with
their winter snows and Arctic winds, and their
chilly summer fogs, really means to a mere thirty
tons of nautical humanity in as many square
leagues of storm-swept sea infested with mines<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and hostile submarines. But when this book has
been finished the reader will be in a position to
judge for himself.</p>

<p>The losses of motor launches were not heavy
considering the dangerous nature of their cargoes
(3000 gallons of petrol within a few feet of 1500
lb. of high explosive in a wooden hull) and the
duties they were called upon to perform in all
weathers short of heavy gales. Several were
blown up with terrible results to those aboard.
Others caught fire and were burned&mdash;allowing only
just sufficient time to sink the explosives aboard.
A few were smashed to pieces on exposed coasts
after struggling for hours amid heavy seas. One
struck a mine off Ostend. Another was destroyed
by shell-fire in the Mediterranean, and the part
they played in the raids on Zeebrugge and Ostend,
in which two were lost and a V.C. gained, is now
world famous.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Coastal Motor Boats</span></div>

<p>There was, besides M.L.'s, another smaller but
faster type of submarine chaser. These little
vessels, of which there were about 80 actually
in commission, possessed no cabin or other accommodation
for long cruises. They were simply
thin grey hulls with powerful high-speed engines.
They were known as C.M.B.'s, or, to give them
their full title, Coastal Motor Boats. The purpose
for which they were constructed was to operate
from coastal bases, and to be launched from ocean-going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
ships to chase a hostile submarine which had
been located by seaplanes and reported by wireless
in a given locality. This, however, was what
they were <i>intended</i> for, but bore little relation to
the work they actually accomplished. Their nickname
was "Scooters," and they certainly did
"scoot" over the sea.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">

<p>There were three types of C.M.B.'s. One had
a length of only 44 feet, and was intended for
carriage on the decks of light cruisers or other
moderate-sized surface ships. The armament was
a Lewis machine gun and two depth charges for
anti-submarine warfare. The next class were 55
feet in length and operated from coast bases.
These were fitted with one or more Whitehead
torpedoes, launched by an ingenious contrivance
from the stern. Class III. were 70 feet in length,
and were commissioned just before the signing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of the Armistice. They were fitted for mine-laying
close up to enemy harbours.</p>

<p>The maximum speed of the 55-feet C.M.B.'s,
which were the most numerous, was 40 knots, or
nearly a mile a minute. They were driven by
twin screws coupled to twin engines of 350 h.p.
each&mdash;working at 1350 revolutions per minute.
Being of very shallow draught, some 26 inches,
these little vessels could skim, hydroplane fashion,
over any ordinary mine-field, and a torpedo fired at
them would merely pass under their keel. The
risk of destruction from shell-fire was also reduced
to a minimum by their small size and great speed.
Their principal enemies were, however, seaplanes
armed with machine guns.</p>

</div>



<p>It is not difficult to imagine a fight between a
C.M.B. travelling at 40 knots, firing with its little
Lewis gun at a big seaplane swooping down from
the clouds at the rate of 70 miles an hour, and
splashing the water around the frail little grey-hulled
scooter with bullets from its machine gun. This
actually occurred many times off the Belgian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
coast, and is a typical picture of guerrilla war at
sea in the twentieth century.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">
<img src="images/i-078.jpg" width="425" height="303" alt="Fig. 5.&mdash;Diagram illustrating method of attack by C.M.B. on surface ship (or submarine on surface)." title="" />

seen that the torpedo, when released, actually follows the ship
from which it is fired until the latter swerves from the straight
course, when the torpedo continues until it strikes or misses
the object of attack, the speed of the torpedo being about the
same or a little less than that of the C.M.B. The total time
occupied in such an attack over a course of two miles would be
about 2&frac12; minutes before the torpedo struck its object.</b></div>

<p>The C.M.B. was a purely British design, and the
firm largely responsible for the success achieved
was Messrs John J. Thornycroft &amp; Company
Limited. There were bases for these sea-gnats at
Portsmouth, Dover, Dunkirk, and in the Thames
Estuary at Osea Island. From all of these points<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
mid-Channel could be reached in less than thirty
minutes. Although useless in rough weather, a
trip in a C.M.B., even on a calm day, was sufficiently
exciting. The roar of the engines made speech
impossible, and vision when sitting in the little
glass-screened well, or conning-tower, was limited
by the great waves of greenish-white water which
curved upwards from either bow, and rolled astern
in a welter of foam. There was an awe-inspiring
fury in the thunder of the 700 h.p. engines revolving
at 1350 per minute, and a feeling of ecstasy
in the stiff breeze of passage and the atomised
spray. When waves came the slap-slap-slap of the
water as the sharp bows cleft through the crest and
the little vessel was for a brief moment poised
dizzily on the bosom of the swell caused tremors
to pass through the thin grey hull, and, to complete
the review of sensation, there may be added the
human thrill of battle and the indescribable feeling
of controlled power beneath one's feet.</p>

<p>The C.M.B.'s record of service, although short, is
nevertheless a brilliant one. Towards the close of
the year 1916 four of these little vessels coming
from the base at Dunkirk intercepted five German
destroyers returning from a Channel raid. The
scooters raced towards the enemy in a smother of
foam. Every quick-firing gun on the German
ships spouted shells at the mysterious white streaks
approaching them with the speed of lightning.
So close did these plucky little ships go to their
giant adversaries that the blast of the German
guns was felt aboard, but no shells struck them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Then the line of C.M.B.'s swerved and their torpedoes
were launched at close range. One of the
enemy destroyers was hit and badly damaged,
while two others had narrow shaves.</p>

<p>There was no time for German retaliation. For
a brief few minutes the sea around the scooters was
ploughed up by the shells from the Hun artillery,
then the four little attacking craft were five miles
distant from the scene of their victory, and presented
almost invisible white specks to the enemy
gunners.</p>

<p>At Zeebrugge these craft ran close in under the
guns of the shore fortifications, and covered the
approach of the landing parties and block-ships
with a screen of artificial smoke. At Ostend they
entered the harbour under heavy fire and ignited
flares to enable the block-ships to navigate in
the darkness. Others, in the same operations,
torpedoed the piers and silenced the guns mounted
thereon.</p>

<p>Their exploits savour of old-time sea romance,
as, for example, when the little <i>Condor</i> ran in under
the guns of the fortress of Alexandria, or further
back in our naval history, when sail and round
shot took the place of petrol and torpedoes.</p>

<p>For anti-submarine work these wonderfully fast
little chasers were used in small flotillas. They
were fitted with short-range wireless sets, and when
the message came stating that a vessel was being
attacked in a certain position, perhaps twenty
miles from the coast, a number were instantly released
from the leash, and in a fraction of the time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
taken by larger vessels they were on the scene with
torpedoes and Lewis guns for surface attack and
depth charges for submerged bombing.</p>

<p>They were commanded, in many instances, by
R.N.V.R. officers of the auxiliary service, and
carried two engineers. No crew was necessary,
nor was space available for them. The plucky
dash of these vessels into the harbours of Zeebrugge
and Ostend, their subsequent operations on the
Belgian coast, and their losses in the action at the
entrance to the Heligoland Bight in 1918, when
they were launched from a big ship, have earned
for them high renown in naval history.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Boom Defence Ships</span></div>

<p>In addition to all these types of anti-submarine
craft there were, forming part of the auxiliary fleet,
over 300 ships, mostly trawlers and drifters, engaged
in maintaining the great lines of boom
defences, closing vast stretches of sheltered waters
frequented by the battle fleets, and a considerable
number of examination ships, staffed by interpreter
officers, whose duty it was to examine all neutral
shipping passing through the 10,000 miles of the
blockade.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>These, then, were the ships of the new navy,
and their formation into flotillas, or units, was
usually accomplished by grouping four or five
vessels of similar type together under the command
of the senior officer afloat&mdash;mostly a lieutenant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
R.N.R. or R.N.V.R. In the case of minesweepers
the unit nearly always consisted of an even number
of ships, because their work was carried out in
pairs, and with M.L.'s it usually consisted
of five boats, as this was the number required
for the intricate tactical work of submarine
chasing.</p>

<p>There were, of course, units from the United
States, French, Japanese, Italian and Brazilian
navies, in addition to the formidable British
armada.</p>

<p>The auxiliary units were all based on one or
other of the fifty odd war stations which encompassed
not only the coasts of Great Britain and
Ireland, but also the littoral of every land in our
world-wide Empire. The numbers given here do
not include the local fleets of purely colonial naval
bases, nor the large flotillas of destroyers and "P"
boats operating in home and foreign waters in
conjunction with the auxiliary navy. If these
were incorporated the anti-submarine fleets would
be almost doubled.</p>

<p>Now that the reader is familiar with the <i>raison
d'&ecirc;tre</i> of the new navy, the personnel, the ships and
their formation into fleets, the scope and limitations
of their activity, and of the losses they sustained,
the way is clear for a description of the
curious weapons used, the mysteries of anti-submarine
warfare, and the bases themselves
before entering the zone of war and seeing something
of the actual work of the auxiliary navy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>THE HYDROPHONE AND THE DEPTH
CHARGE</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Of</span> all the weapons used in the anti-submarine war
the two most important were the <i>hydrophone</i> and
the <i>depth charge</i>. They were employed in conjunction
with each other and comprised the surface
warship's principal means of offence against submarines
operating beneath the surface.</div>

<p>The hydrophone resembles a delicate telephone.
It is so constructed that when the instrument is
lowered over the side of a ship into the sea any
noise, such as the movement of a submarine's propellers,
can be heard on deck by an operator listening
at an ordinary telephone receiver connected
to the submerged microphone by an electrified
wire.</p>

<p>There were many different types of hydrophone
in use during the Great War. So important was
this instrument for the work of submarine hunting
that money was spent in millions, and a corps of
naval and civil experts were engaged for several
years, bringing it to a state of efficiency. Each
type introduced into the Service was an improvement
on its predecessor, and there were different
patterns for the use of almost each class of vessel.
The fast destroyer required a different instrument<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
to the slow-moving trawler. The motor launch
could only employ successfully a totally different
type to the submarine, and, to add to the difficulties,
the German submarines themselves were
generously supplied with similar instruments. The
games of "hide-and-seek" played on and under
the seas with the aid of this wonderful little instrument
would have been distinctly amusing had
men's lives&mdash;and often those of women and children&mdash;not
been dependent upon the issue.</p>

<p>The portable hydrophone, used by some of the
smaller and slower vessels of the auxiliary fleet,
consisted of a microphone, or delicate mechanical
ear, carefully guarded by metal discs from accidental
damage, and connected to ear-pieces or
ordinary telephone receivers by an electric wire
which passed through a battery. Where the wire
came in contact with the sea water it was heavily
insulated and lightly armoured.</p>

<p>When it was required to use this instrument the
vessel was stopped and the microphone lowered
overboard to a depth of about 20 feet. This was
the distance down from the surface at which submarine
noises could be heard most distinctly. The
operator on deck or in the cabin then adjusted the
ear-pieces and sat listening for any noises coming
through the water. Although the sea is a far
better conductor than air, the range at which
sounds could be heard varied considerably. On a
calm day or night the noise of a ship's propellers
could frequently be distinguished at from five to
seven miles; whereas on a rough day, with the sea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
splashing and the wind roaring, it was often difficult
to hear anything beyond half-a-mile.</p>

and wires <i>B</i> to the ear-pieces <i>A</i>.</b></div>

<p>In fine weather a submarine could usually be
heard at a distance of about two or three miles.
There were, however, many microscopic noises of
the under-seas which were picked up and magnified<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
by this type of hydrophone. They were called
"water noises," and often made it extremely difficult
to differentiate between them and the sound
of a moving submarine at a great distance. Later
types were not so prone to these disturbing influences.</p>

<p>To describe here the different natural and artificial
noises heard on a portable hydrophone is
extremely difficult. One general statement can,
however, be made. It is the noise caused by the
rapidly revolving propellers of both surface ships
and submarines that is the guiding factor in
the work of detection by submarine sound. A
destroyer travelling at full speed on a calm sea,
when heard on a hydrophone resembles the roar
of a gigantic dynamo. The sound does not alter
as the distance between the <i>stationary</i> listening
ship and the <i>fast-moving</i> warship increases or decreases;
it continues to be a roar or low hum,
according to distance, until it fades out of hearing
altogether. The same statement applies also to a
slow-moving cargo steamer, only in this case the
<i>single</i> propeller is revolving very much slower, and,
when listening on a hydrophone about two or three
miles distant, each successive beat of the engines
can be distinctly heard.</p>

<p>The simple movement of a vessel's hull through
the water cannot be heard on a hydrophone.
Therefore for detecting the presence in the vicinity
of a <i>sailing</i> ship at night or in a thick fog this instrument
is quite useless. The same drawback
applies also to the location of a floating derelict or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
iceberg, and restricts the use of the hydrophone to
faithfully reporting the presence of power-driven
ships or special sound signals at a range of a few
miles.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i-087.jpg" width="450" height="215" alt="Fig. 7.&mdash;An improved directional hydrophone fitted through keel of motor launch." title="" />
</div>
<div class='hang1'><b><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span>&mdash;An improved directional hydrophone fitted through keel of
motor launch. The tube <i>B</i>, at the lower extremity of which is
the microphone, can be raised or lowered from <i>C</i>, the cabin of
the M.L. This instrument is so arranged that the direction
from which the submarine sound is coming can be simply and
quickly ascertained.</b></div>

<p>A German submarine heard at a range of about
a mile on a calm night presents a curious sound
which almost defies description. Its principal
constituent consists of a "clankety clank!
clankety clank!" at first barely distinguishable
from the low swish of the water past the face of
the submerged microphone, then louder when the
sound has been distinguished and the human ear
is on the alert. But when this sound was heard in
war there was little time for analysing or noting.
It was the call to action. The microphone was
hauled to the surface and the chase began, a halt
being made every half-mile or so for a further<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
period of listening on the hydrophone. If the
sound was louder the commander of the pursuing
vessel knew that he was on the right track, and if
the sound came up from the sea more indistinct
the course was changed and a run of a mile made
in the opposite direction, when the vessel was again
stopped and the instrument dropped overboard.</p>

<p>Should this man[oe]uvre have placed the surface
ship in close proximity to the submarine, one or
more <i>depth charges</i> were released, and if the explosion
of these damaged the comparatively delicate
hull or machinery of the under-water craft, she had
either to rise to the surface and fight for her life
with her two powerful deck guns, or, if badly
damaged, sink helplessly to the bottom, emitting
oil in large quantities from her crushed tanks.</p>

<p>Before entering upon a description of the depth
charge, however, there is more to say of the hydrophone,
which has played such an important part in
the defeat of the U-boats.</p>

<p>When the advantages of this instrument had
been fully demonstrated in the stern trial of war,
successful efforts were made to improve upon the
original crude appliances. The "water noises"
were reduced and, greatest improvement of all, the
hydrophone was made "directional." By this is
meant that when a sound was heard its approximate
direction north, south, east or west of the
listening ship could be more or less accurately
determined. What this improvement meant to a
vessel hunting a submarine in a vast stretch of sea
will be easily realised. When the sound came up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the wires from the submerged microphone the
operator had simply to turn a small handle in order
to determine from which direction the noise was
coming.</p>

<p>If, for example, the sound was first heard away
to the east, the instrument was turned to another
quarter of the compass. Then, if the noise was
plainer, the instrument was turned again until
the sound decreased in intensity. In this way the
line of maximum sound was obtained, and this
showed the direction from the listening ship in
which the U-boat was operating.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i-089.jpg" width="450" height="92" alt="Fig. 8.&mdash;Plan showing how microphones or ears B are fitted in a submarine A to enable it to detect the approach of surface craft." title="" />
</div>
<div class='hang1'><b><span class="smcap">Fig. 8.</span>&mdash;Plan showing how microphones or ears <i>B</i> are fitted in a submarine
<i>A</i> to enable it to detect the approach of surface craft.</b></div>

<p>With the perfection of this invention the hydrophone
section of the naval service came into being.
Special courses in the detection of submarine sounds
were instituted for officers and also for seamen
listeners. The actual movements of a submarine
under water at varying distances from a hydrophone
were recorded by a phonograph, and records
made so that the sounds might be reproduced at
will for the education of the ear. Surgeons with
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'oral'">aural</ins> experience estimated the physical efficiency
in this respect of would-be volunteers for the
hydrophone-listening service, and vessels were
formed into special hydrophone flotillas, whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
duties consisted of listening in long lines for submarines
and when a discovery was made attacking
them in the most approved tactical formation,
with the aid of depth charges and guns.</p>

<p>A considerable measure of success attended these
arrangements, and the author spent many cold
hours listening at night for the sound of the wily
submarine. On more than one occasion an exciting
chase resulted.</p>

<p>It must, however, be pointed out that there is
one great drawback to the successful use of the
hydrophone. It exists in the necessity for the
listening ship to stop before the hydrophone is
hoisted outboard, it being quite impossible to hear
anything beyond the roar of the engines of the
carrying ship so long as they are in motion.
Furthermore, all progress through the water must
have ceased and the listening ship have become
stationary before artificial sounds, such as the propellers
of a submarine, can be distinguished from
the natural noises of the sea water.</p>

<p>Now it will at once be apparent that not only
does a stationary ship offer a splendid target for
under-water attack, but also it allows a somewhat
humorous game of hide-and-seek to be played between
a hunting vessel and a hunted submarine.</p>

<p>Nearly all U-boats were fitted with a number of
hydrophones and therefore were as well able to
receive timely warning of an approaching surface
ship as the surface ship was of the presence of the
submarine. But the surface ship had the advantage
of speed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>The result of all this was that when a German
submarine heard a surface vessel approaching she
dived to the bottom, if the water was not too deep
or the sea-bed too rocky. Then shutting off her
engines she listened. The surface ship, mystified
by the sudden cessation of the noise she had been
pursuing, also waited, and this stagnation sometimes
lasted for hours. Then if the surface ship
moved, as she was often compelled to do in order
to avoid drifting with the tide away from the
locality, the submarine moved also, and the one
that stopped her engines first detected the other,
but could not catch up to her again without
deafening her own listening appliance. In which
case the next move would probably be in favour of
her opponent.</p>

<p>All of this is, perhaps, a little complicated, but
a moment's pause for reflection will make this
curious situation clear to the reader. And so the
game went on, with decisive advantage to neither
the surface ship nor the submarine. Darkness
usually intervened and put an end to further
man[oe]uvring, frequently allowing the submarine
to escape.</p>

<p>A case of this kind occurred to a vessel, of a
certain hydrophone flotilla, commanded by the
author. For over four hours the U-boat eluded
the pursuing surface ships by moving only when
they moved and stopping when they too had
stopped, darkness and a rising sea eventually
favouring the escape of the submarine, which, a
few hours later, was able to attack (unsuccessfully)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
a big surface ship less than thirty miles distant
from the scene.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the hydrophone is a submarine
instrument with a brilliant future. It has already
been improved out of all resemblance to its original
self, and more will undoubtedly follow. It is,
however, purely an appliance for the detection of
submarines when cruising beneath the surface, and
not a weapon for their destruction. It should also
be remembered that any improvement made in the
efficiency of the hydrophone will benefit not only
the surface ship, but also the submarine, for it
cannot be supposed that under-water craft will
be left without these wonderful submarine ears
when their surface destroyers are equipped with
them.</p>

<p>The alliance between the hydrophone and the
depth charge is a natural one. The former instrument
enables the surface ship to discover, first,
the presence of a submarine in the vicinity, and,
secondly, its approximate position. At this point
its utility <i>temporarily</i> ceases and that of the depth
charge begins. When a surface ship is hot on
the track of a moving submarine she endeavours
to attain a position directly over the top of her
quarry, or even a little ahead, and then releases
one or more depth charges according to whether
the chance of a hit is good or only poor.</p>

<p>From this it will be apparent that whereas the
hydrophone is the instrument used for the initial
detection of the submarine, and afterwards for
enabling the surface ship to get to close quarters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
with her submerged adversary, it is the depth
charge with which the attack is actually made.</p>

<p>This weapon is really a powerful submarine
bomb. It consists of several hundred pounds of
very high explosive encased in a steel shell, with a
special firing device which can quickly be set so
that the charge explodes at almost any depth
below the surface after being released from the
above-water vessel.</p>

<p>The methods in use during the war for its
release from the decks of surface ships were very
diverse, the most usual being for a number of
these weapons to be fitted on slides and held in
place by wire slings which could be released by
simply pulling out a greased pin or bolt.</p>

<p>When the depth charge rolled off the stern of
the surface ship it sank to the "set depth" and
then exploded like a submarine mine. The result
was a shattering effect exerted through the water
for several hundred feet around. If the submarine
was close to the explosion her comparatively thin
plates were nearly always stove-in. When she
was over a hundred feet away, however, the
rivets holding her plates together were often
loosened, and the resulting leak frequently compelled
her to come to the surface, where she could
be destroyed by gun-fire.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/i-094.jpg" width="550" height="350" alt="Dropping Depth Charges" title="" />
<div class='attrib'><i>British Official Photograph</i></div>
<span class="caption">Dropping Depth Charges</span>
</div>


<p>It often happened, however, that neither one
nor the other of these things occurred, but that
the submarine's delicate electrical machinery was
thrown out of order by the violence of a depth-charge
explosion, even when a considerable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
distance away. With the electric engines used
for submerged propulsion no longer available, and
possibly the interior of the vessel in darkness,
there were only two courses open. She could
either rise to the surface and endeavour to fight it
out with the aid of her powerful deck guns, or else
sink to the bottom and trust to luck that other
depth charges would not be dropped close enough
to seriously damage her hull. In the open sea,
however, the latter chance was denied because of
the depth of water. Three hundred feet may be
taken as the greatest depth to which an ordinarily
constructed fighting submarine can safely descend
without running a grave risk of having her plates
crushed in by the great water pressure. Even at
this depth the weight on every square foot of hull
surface exceeds 8&frac34; tons.</p>

<p>If the damaged submarine rose to the surface
the guns of her pursuers were ready and could
generally be relied upon to place her at least <i>hors
de combat</i> before the hatches of the under-water
vessel could be opened and her own guns brought
into action.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<p>In shallow water where there was a fairly smooth
bottom it generally happened that a submarine
damaged by depth charges elected to sink to the
sea-bed and trust to luck. This was also frequently
resorted to as a means of eluding pursuit
even when the U-boat was not damaged by the first
few charges dropped. It was then that the hydrophones
carried by the surface ships were again
brought into use to ascertain if the submarine was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
still under way. When no sound was heard those
on the surface knew that "Fritz" was lying doggo,
or else that he had escaped. If a number of ships
were available a few waited over the spot where it
was considered the U-boat was lying, while the others
scoured the surrounding seas in circles trying to
pick up the sound of the runaway's engines if she
had escaped in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e. When nothing further<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
was heard they returned to the scene and set
about the work of systematically bombing the
surrounding sea-bed.</p>

<p>As many as one hundred depth charges were
dropped in quite a small area of sea and yet a
submarine known to have been lying "doggo"
in the locality was not damaged. In cases such
as this other means, which will be described in a
succeeding chapter, were then resorted to.</p>

<p>All the foregoing sounds very thorough and
hopeful, but in fairness it must be said that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
submarine hunting is a heart-breaking task. The
reader may have noticed that the method of depth-charge
attack presupposes the surface vessel to
have attained a position almost directly over the
top of her enemy, a man[oe]uvre extremely difficult
of achievement even with the most efficient hydrophone.
Heavy seas, snow and fog have also to be
taken into consideration, to say nothing of darkness,
the presence of a second submarine, a surf-beaten
rock or sandbank and the confusing sounds
of passing merchant ships, making a difficult task
more difficult, as will be seen when we come to the
actual fighting.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>SOME CURIOUS WEAPONS OF ANTI-SUBMARINE
WARFARE</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Although</span> modern war has shown that there
exists no certain antidote for the submarine, it
nevertheless brought into being many curious
weapons of attack and defence. It is the purpose
of this chapter to describe some of the anti-submarine
devices used with more or less successful
results during the protracted naval operations
against the Central Powers.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Indicator Nets</span></div>

<p>Among the most important of these were the immense
meshes of wire known as "indicator nets,"
which were used to entangle a submarine and then
to proclaim her movements to surface ships waiting
to attack with guns and depth charges.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i-101.jpg" width="450" height="383" alt="Fig. 11.&mdash;Diagram showing principal features of a line of submerged indicator nets." title="" />
</div>

<div class='hang1'><b><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span>&mdash;Diagram showing principal features of a line of submerged
indicator nets. <i>AA.</i> Two sections (100 feet in breadth) of thin
wire-netting with a very wide mesh. <i>B.</i> Framework of wire rope
holding each section of net in place by means of metal clips <i>C</i>.
<i>C.</i> Metal clips which expand and release netting from rope frame
when a pull of more than 100 lb. is exerted upon them. <i>D.</i> Line
of invisible glass balls, or hollow floats, attached to a surface wire
<i>E</i>, supporting by wires <i>F</i>, the nets which hang down from the
surface vertically in long lines (&frac12; to 1 mile in length and 50 feet
deep). <i>G.</i> Heavy iron weights or sinkers holding down the nets
by their weight when hanging in water. <i>H.</i> Wooden floats, attached
to each section of net by wires <i>I</i>. <i>J.</i> Canisters of chemical
which give off flame and smoke when exposed to sea-water.
<i>K.</i> Lanyard attached to surface wire <i>E</i>. When a section of net
is pulled out of its wire frame by a submarine passing through the
line the float is dragged along the surface by the wire <i>I</i>. The
lanyard is held back by being attached to surface wire <i>E</i>, and pulls
a plug out of the canister <i>J</i>, exposing the chemical inside to the
sea-water (see<a href="#Fig_12"> Fig. 1</a>2).</b></div>

<p>These nets were made of specially light but
strong wire, with a mesh of several feet. They
were joined together in lengths of 100 feet by
metal clips which opened when a certain strain was
exerted on any particular section. Their depth
was usually about 50 feet, and they were laid in
lengths varying from a few hundred yards to two
miles. Weights at the lower end and invisible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
glass floats along the top held them suspended
vertically from the surface. The floats were kept<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
in place by a wire hawser running along the top
of the nets, and to this were attached, at intervals,
wooden buoys containing tin cases filled with a
chemical compound which, when brought into
contact with sea-water, emitted dense smoke by
day and flame by night.</p>

<p>The 100-feet sections were linked together, and
to the top and bottom ropes, by the metal clips.
These clips opened when a submarine headed into
that part of the line. The result was that a section
of net enveloped the bow of the under-water craft,
was detached from the line and carried along,
dragging its <i>indicator float</i> on the surface behind.</p>

<p>The indicator float, containing the chemical, was
attached (1) to the section of net by a short wire
and (2) to the top rope of the whole line by a
lanyard, which, when pulled free, exposed the
chemical contents of the canisters in the float to
the sea-water. The float was then dragged along
the surface burning furiously.</p>

<p>As there was nothing to materially impede her
progress, a submarine would consequently be unaware
that she had passed through a line of nets
and was actually towing a flaming buoy. Even if
she became aware of the tell-tale appendage it
would be extremely difficult to clear herself, owing
to the forward hydroplanes becoming entangled in
the wire-netting, before the fast surface ships,
waiting in readiness, had spotted the flaming buoy
being towed along and were hot in pursuit.</p>

<p>Once entangled in such a net, the submarine's
chance of avoiding destruction was small. Not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
only did the indicator buoy proclaim her every
movement to the pursuing surface ships, so that
she could not avoid them by turning, sinking to the
bottom or doubling in her tracks, but it also enabled
depth charges to be literally dropped on her decks.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">

movements, is being towed along the surface.</b></div>

<p>A considerable measure of success attended the
use of this ingenious device until "Fritz" became
shy of waters close inshore, and kept a careful
look-out for possible lines of indicator nets when
forced to pass through narrow channels and waterways.
One of the main disadvantages attending
the use of these nets was the impossibility of laying
them&mdash;or, when laid, of hauling them inboard
again, during even moderately rough seas. Another
difficulty which presented itself when indicator<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
nets were required to be laid in the open sea was
the screening of the waiting surface ships from
observation. Submarines could not be used on
account of their slow speed, and when fast patrol
craft cruised about openly within easy range of
the nets "Fritz" suspected a trap and steered
clear. Even this, however, had its uses.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Mine Nets</span></div>

<p>It was sought to overcome this difficulty by attaching
small explosive mines to the nets instead
of indicator floats, so that when a submarine passed
through a line she unavoidably struck one or other
of the attached mines, which instantly exploded.</p>

<p>This device also proved fairly successful, but
the dangers of handling mined nets were considerable
and disasters resulted. Furthermore, as such
obstructions could not be securely moored in one
spot for very long, owing to the action of gales
and strong tides, it became necessary for the sake
of neutral and allied shipping to maintain a vessel
in the vicinity from which warnings could be issued
and repairs to the nets effected. This partly defeated
the object of mined nets, except for the
closing of narrow fair-ways, and their scope as a
weapon of attack became strictly limited.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Modified Sweep</span></div>

<p>This elaborate and costly anti-submarine device
was very widely, but not altogether successfully,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
employed by the auxiliary fleet during the first
two years of war. It was nothing more than a
long explosive tail towed submerged by a surface
ship, the object being to either drag it over a submarine
resting on the sea-bed, or else, if the under-water
craft was moving, to so man[oe]uvre the towing
surface ship as to swing the tail close to the U-boat,
when the heavy charges of T.N.T. attached to the
armoured electric cable, forming the tail, would be
exploded either by actual contact with the hull
of the enemy, or, when sufficiently close to be
effective, by the closing of a firing circuit on board
the surface ship.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i-105.jpg" width="450" height="170" alt="Fig. 13.&mdash;Diagram showing a vessel towing a modified sweep." title="" />
</div>
<div class='hang1'><b><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.</span>&mdash;Diagram showing a vessel towing a modified sweep. This
appliance consists of an armoured electric cable <i>G</i> towed in vertical

<i>E</i>, which have strikers attached. If a submarine <i>B</i> is lying
"doggo" on the sea-bed one or other of these charges may strike
her hull and the whole line then blows up, shattering everything
in the surrounding sea. If the strikers fitted on the charges do not
touch the submarine the whole line can be exploded at will from
the surface ship by closing an electric circuit.</b></div>

<p>Excellent in theory but very difficult of accomplishment
in actual practice. The diagram given
will explain the details of this elaborate contrivance,
which, however, was soon discarded for more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
practical methods, although at least one German
submarine is known to have been destroyed by it.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Lance Bombs</span></div>

<p>These little engines of destruction were intended
for fighting at close quarters, and can be described
here in a few lines because of their guileless simplicity.
They consisted of conical explosive bombs
on the ends of broom handles! A strong man
could whirl one of them round his head, like a
two-handed sword or battle-axe, and, when the
momentum was sufficient, hurl it over the water
for about seventy-five feet. On nose-diving into
the sea and hitting the hull of a submarine in the
act of rising or plunging, the little bomb, containing
about 7 lb. of amatol, was exploded by
contact.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i-106.jpg" width="400" height="48" alt="Fig. 14.&mdash;A lance bomb." title="" />
</div>
<div class='hang1'><b><span class="smcap">Fig. 14.</span>&mdash;A lance bomb. The wooden handle <i>A</i> enables the
charge <i>B</i> (7 lb. of high explosive) to be whirled round the
head and hurled a distance of about twenty yards.</b></div>

<p>The damage inflicted on one of the earlier types
of submarines by an under-water hand-grenade or
lance bomb depended entirely upon what part of
the vessel happened to be struck. Their sphere
of usefulness was, from the first, very limited, and
the advent of the big cruiser submarine, with
armoured conning-tower and 5-inch guns, rendered
them obsolete.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Smoke Screens</span></div>

<p>We now come to a more useful device of the
purely defensive type employed to screen surface
ships from submarine attack. The very simple
mechanical and chemical apparatus needed for
making the heavy clouds of smoke needs no description
beyond that given in the text, but
something must be said here regarding the methods
of use.</p>

<p>It was not until the third year of the Great War
had been ushered in by the unprecedented sinking
of Allied merchantmen by German U-boats that
the value of the smoke screen as a means of
baffling an under-water attack was fully realised.
Convoy guards were supplied with the necessary
appliances for emitting the fumes with which to
cover the movements of the ships under their
protection, and so successful was this method of
blinding attacking submarines that within a few
months thousands of transports, food-ships and
warships had been equipped.</p>

<p>When a submarine proclaimed her presence in
the vicinity of a convoy either by showing too
much of her periscope or by a misdirected torpedo,
the guard-ships on the flank attacked immediately
dropped their smoke buoys as they continued
moving at full speed. By this means an impenetrable
optical barrier was interposed between the
attacking submarine and the fleet of merchantmen
under convoy. When thus shielded from attack&mdash;a
submarine values her small stock of torpedoes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
(six to ten) too highly to risk the loss of one or more
on something she cannot even see&mdash;the mercantile
fleet altered course so as to present their sterns to
the attacking U-boat, while certain prearranged
warships belonging to the escort proceeded to the
attack with guns and depth charges.</p>

<p>This means of masking the movements of ships&mdash;by
no means new in naval warfare&mdash;was employed
with conspicuous success in the operations
of Allied squadrons off Zeebrugge. Individual
merchantmen, when attacked by one or more
submarines, often threw out a smoke screen to
avoid destruction by the big surface guns of the
more modern German craft, and its use to cover
the movements of transports was very frequently
resorted to.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Camouflage</span></div>

<p>The use of camouflage, or the deceptive painting
and rigging of ships, came first into being owing to
the method employed by submarines for judging
the speed of passing surface ships by the white
wave thrown off from their bows. It is of the
utmost importance for the commander of an under-water
warship to correctly judge the speed of the
vessel he is about to attack before discharging a
torpedo at her. If the estimated speed is too high
the torpedo will, in all probability, pass ahead of
the moving target, and if it is too low it will run
harmlessly astern.</p>

<p>To cause this to happen as frequently as possible,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and valuable torpedoes to be wasted&mdash;even if the
attacking submarine herself could not then be
discovered and destroyed&mdash;it became advisable to
paint imitation white waves on the bows of slow-moving
ships in order to give the appearance of
speed.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">
<img src="images/i-109.jpg" width="425" height="168" alt="Fig. 15.&mdash;A camouflaged ship." title="" />
</div>

<div class='hang1'><b><span class="smcap">Fig. 15.</span>&mdash;A camouflaged ship. It will be observed that a vessel
so painted would, from a distance of several miles, give the
appearance of a ship sinking while headed in the opposite
direction.</b></div>

<p>So successful was this simple form of deceptive
paint-work that a special camouflage section of the
naval service, with an eminent artist as its director,
was formed, and all kinds of grotesque designs were
painted on the broadsides and superstructures of
almost every British merchantman operating in
the submarine danger zone.</p>

<p>There was method and meaning in the seemingly
haphazard streaks of black, green, blue and white.
When looked at from close range only a jumble
of colours could at first be seen, but if the distance
was increased the effect became instantly apparent.
In some cases the deceptive decoration caused big
ocean liners to appear small and insignificant. In
others it gave the appearance that the vessel was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
sinking; while quite a favourite ruse was to cause
the vessel to appear as if she was travelling in the
opposite direction to that which she really was.
Two-funnelled ships became single-funnelled, when
viewed from a distance or in a dim light, by the
simple expedient of painting one funnel black and
the other light grey. Liners with tiers of passenger
decks had the latter obscured by contrasts of
colouring which were really masterpieces of deceptive
art. In fact so deceptive became almost
every ship in the dim light of dawn and dusk that
collisions were often narrowly averted.</p>

<p>It frequently occurred that paint alone was not
sufficient to disguise a ship, and woodwork and
canvas were resorted to. Big guns were made of
drain-pipes and shields of the wood from packing-cases.
Cargo boats were given the appearance of
cruisers, and cruisers reduced to the appearance of
cargo boats. In this way hostile submarines were
induced to attack ships, thinking them unarmed
and helpless, when in reality they were small floating
forts. But at this point simple camouflage
ceases and the famous <i>Mystery Ship</i> begins. Before
closing this chapter, however, it must be pointed
out that camouflage only came into being when
the German U-boats commenced their ruthless
submarine warfare.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>MYSTERY SHIPS</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> "Q" boat, or mystery ship, has been surrounded
by so much secrecy that to most people
its very being is an unknown quantity. Yet it is
to these curious vessels of all sizes and types that
the destruction of many hostile submarines was
due, and the dangerous work performed by their
intrepid crews equalled anything described in
sea romance.</div>

<p>The mystery ship was not a specially constructed
war vessel, such as a destroyer or cruiser, but
merely a merchantman converted into a powerfully
armed patrol ship, camouflaged to give the
appearance of genuine innocence, but with masked
batteries, hulls stuffed with wood to render them
almost unsinkable, hidden torpedo tubes, picked
gunners, a roving commission and a daring commander
and crew. Their work was performed on
the broad highways of the sea, and they hunted
singly or in pairs, often fighting against overwhelming
odds with certain death as the price of
failure.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i-112a.jpg" width="400" height="310" alt="Innocent Looking but Deadly, H.M.S. &quot;Hyderabad&quot;" title="" />

<span class="caption">Innocent Looking but Deadly, H.M.S. &quot;Hyderabad&quot;</span>
<p>The famous "Mystery Ship," powerfully built to resemble a helpless merchantman.
Sitting almost flat on the surface of the sea the torpedoes from U-boats ran harmlessly
beneath her keel.</p></div>




<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i-112b.jpg" width="400" height="313" alt="The Hidden Torpedo Tubes of H.M.S. &quot;Hyderabad&quot;" title="" />
<div class='attrib'><i>Thornycroft &amp; Co., Ltd.</i></div>
<span class="caption">The Hidden Torpedo Tubes of H.M.S. &quot;Hyderabad&quot;</span>
</div>


<p>The number of these vessels was not large,
possibly 180, but their operations extended
far and wide. They roamed the North Sea, the
Atlantic, the English Channel, the Mediterranean,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the Arctic Ocean and even the Baltic, but until
challenged were quite unknown to all other vessels
of the Allied navies. Theirs was a secret service,
performed amidst great hardships, with no popular
applause to spur them on.</p>

<p>As all "Q" boats&mdash;as they were officially called&mdash;differed
from each other in size and armament,
any description given here can only be taken as
applying to one or more vessels with which the
writer was personally familiar. Some of these
so-called mystery ships were old sailing schooners,
others fine steamships, while quite a number were
converted fishing smacks, drifters and trawlers,
the method being to give the prospective commander
a free hand in the conversion of his ship
from a peaceable merchantman to a camouflaged
man-of-war, and many were the ingenious devices
used.</p>

<p>One vessel fitted out for this desperate duty at
a Scottish base was a steamer of about 400 tons
burden. She was armed with a 4<sup>.</sup>7 quick-firing
gun hidden in a deck-house with imitation glass
windows, the sides of which could be dropped flat
on to the deck for the gun to be trained outboard
by simply pressing an electric button on the
steamer's bridge. Two life-boats, one on each side
of the aft deck, were bottomless, and formed covers
for two additional 12-pounder guns. A false deck
in the bow shielded a pair of wicked-looking torpedo
tubes, each containing an 18-inch Whitehead ready
for launching; and the crew for each gun were
able to reach their respective weapons, without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
appearing on deck, by means of specially constructed
gangways and hatches. The very act of
dropping the sides of the aft gun-house hoisted
the White Ensign, and technically converted this
unsuspicious-looking merchantman, which asked
only to be allowed to pursue its lawful vocation
on the high seas, into a heavily armed warship.</p>

<p>This "Q" boat had, when met and challenged
by the writer's ship, already accounted for no less
than three German submarines which had opened
the attack from close range, thinking her defenceless.</p>

<p>Another smaller mystery ship was a converted
fishing drifter with a single 12-pounder gun on a
specially strengthened platform fitted in the fish-hold,
which had been cleaned, matchboarded and
painted to provide accommodation for the crew of
picked gunners. This little ship had no torpedo
tubes and the muzzle of her gun was hidden beneath
fishing nets.</p>

<p>There were, however, some very large and
elaborately fitted "Q" boats. These had specially
constructed torpedo tubes low down in the hull,
masked 4<sup>.</sup>7-inch guns in more than one position,
special chutes for depth charges, coal bunkers
arranged round the vital machinery to protect it
from shell-fire, and, moreover, were filled with
wood to make them almost unsinkable even if
torpedoed.</p>

<p>Each such vessel was provided with a "panic
party," whose duty was to rush to the life-boats
when the ship was attacked by a submarine. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
gave the final touch to the disguise, and often
induced the submarine to save further torpedoes
by coming to the surface and continuing the
assault with gun-fire.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">

<p>The story of the sinking of the last German submarine
in the war by the "Q 19" will give some
idea of how these vessels worked. It occurred in
the Straits of Gibraltar, about twenty-four hours
before the signing of the Armistice. The Q 19
was waiting in the Straits expecting to intercept
three big U-boats on their way back to Heligoland.
About midnight the first of these craft came along,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
and sighting the innocent-looking "Q" boat prepared
to attack her with gun-fire. For nearly an
hour the mystery ship "played" the submarine
by pretending to make frantic efforts to escape,
but all the time allowing the under-water craft to
draw closer and closer.</p>

<p>The "Q" boat was under a heavy fire from the
submarine, one shell wounding eleven out of the
crew of sixty, another carrying away the mast and
a portion of the funnel, but no sign of a gun was
yet displayed on board the surface ship. This
withholding of fire until the last moment, when
the range has become short and the effect certain,
is one of the great nerve tests imposed on the crews
of all mystery ships. It is an essential of success,
for a few wild shots at long range would disclose
the fact that the vessel was heavily armed, and
the attacking submarine would either sheer off or
else submerge and use her torpedoes.</p>

<p>When the chase had been on for about fifty
minutes, and the submarine was only 200 yards
astern, the "panic party" in the "Q" boat
rushed for the life-boats. The shells were now
doing serious damage to both hull and upper
works, and the submarine was creeping close to
give the <i>coup de gr&acirc;ce</i>.</p>

<p>At this, the psychological moment, the order
to open fire was given. The collapsible deck-house,
shielding the 4<sup>.</sup>7 gun, fell away on its hinges.
Eleven shots were fired in quick succession, all of
which struck the submarine. One blew the commander
off the conning-tower and another rent a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
gaping hole in the vessel's hull. In less than fifteen
minutes the fight was over and the last U-boat to
be sunk in the Great War of civilisation had disappeared
beneath the waters of the Straits of
Gibraltar.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>A TYPICAL WAR BASE</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> last few chapters have dealt mainly with the
weapons used in anti-submarine warfare. We
now come to the naval bases on which the fleets
armed with these curious devices were stationed
for active operations.</div>

<p>Around the coasts of the British Isles there were
about forty of these war bases, each with its own
patrol flotillas, minesweeping units and hunting
squadrons. The harbours, breakwaters and docks
had to be furnished with stores, workshops, wireless
stations, quarters for officers and men, searchlights,
oil-storage tanks, coal bunkers, magazines,
fire equipment, guard-rooms, signal stations,
hospitals, pay offices, dry docks, intelligence
centres and all the vitally necessary stores,
machinery and equipment of small dockyards.</p>

<p>To do this in the shortest possible time, and to
maintain the supplies of such rapidly consumed
materials as oil fuel, coal, food, paint, rope and
shells for perhaps a hundred ships for an indefinite
number of years, it was often necessary to lay down
metals and sidings to connect the base with the
nearest railway system. At many bases secure
moorings had also to be laid by divers, and the
channels and fair-ways dredged. The larger bases<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
also required temporary shore defences, and booms
arranged across the harbour entrances to prevent
hostile under-water attacks.</p>

<p>Then came the problem of finding the personnel.
The ships had already been provided for, but to
keep them in fighting condition, and for the work
of administration, it was necessary to have a shore
navy behind the sea-going units. An admiral from
the active or retired list was appointed to each
base as the "Senior Naval Officer." Then came
additions to his staff in the persons of executive
and engineer commanders, officers of the Reserve,
chaplains, surgeons and paymasters. With these
departmental chiefs came their respective staffs of
warrant officers, petty officers, wireless operators,
engine-room artificers, motor mechanics, shipwrights,
carpenters, smiths, naval police, signalmen,
storekeepers, sick berth attendants and
parties of seamen. Finally, a generous supply of
printed forms and train-loads of stores.</p>

<p>This then, in brief outline, was the material
which went to form the war bases of the auxiliary,
or anti-submarine, fleets. In many cases much
more was required, especially at such important
dep&ocirc;ts as Dover, Granton and Queenstown. About
the permanent dockyards, like Portsmouth, Devonport
and Rosyth, or the Grand Fleet bases, nothing
need be said here, because they do not come within
the scope of this book. The same may also be said
of that desolate but wonderful natural anchorage,
<i>Scapa Flow</i>, the headquarters of the Grand Fleet in
the misty north. Each of these mammoth naval<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
bases had an auxiliary base for anti-submarine
and minesweeping divisions.</p>

<p>With a knowledge of these essentials a more
detailed description of a typical war base and the
work of its staff may prove of interest. Taking
as an example a large dep&ocirc;t, supplying all the needs
of over a hundred erstwhile warships, and situated
in the centre of the danger zone, we find a central
stone pier on which has been erected a perfect maze
of wood and corrugated iron buildings, with the
tall antenn&aelig; of a wireless station, a little look-out
tower and a gigantic signal mast from which a line
of coloured flags is aflutter in the sea breeze. The
shore end of the pier is shut off from prying eyes
by a lofty wooden palisade with big gates, in one
of which is a small wicket. Outside a sentry with
fixed bayonet paces to and fro.</p>

<p>The first person inside the sacred precincts to
greet the stranger is a keen-eyed "Petty Officer of
the Guard." When the credentials have been
examined the visitor is sent under the guidance of
a bluejacket to the "Officer of the Day," whose
"cabin" is inside the maze of corrugated iron
and weather-board. The doors flanking the
passages traversed display cryptic lettering, such
as I.O. (Intelligence Office), S.R. (Signal Room),
S.N.O. (Senior Naval Officer), "Commander"
(usually the second in command of the base),
P.M.S.O. (Port Minesweeping Officer), C.B.O.
(Confidential Book Office), M.L.Com. (Motor
Launch Commander), O.O.W. (Officer of the
Watch), "Officers only" (the wardroom and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
gunroom combined), and, finally, the O.O.D., or the
abode of that much-worried individual, the Officer
of the Day, whose duties happily terminate when
his twenty-four hours of administrative responsibility
are over, only, however, to return in strict
rotation.</p>

<p>Again comes an apologetic examination of
credentials, possibly followed by a few minutes
with the admiral commanding, and then the grand
tour commences. First come the ships lying
alongside the stone pier, with their short funnels
belching black and very sooty smoke. These are
the "stand-off" units, whose crews are enjoying
a brief few hours ashore after days or weeks out
on the dangerous seas beyond. Big drums of oil
are being lowered by ropes on to their decks. The
sound of hammering comes from more than one
engine-room, where machinery is being overhauled.
On the decks of several, men with little or no resemblance
to the clean "Jacks" of the naval
review are fondly polishing, painting or greasing
the long grey barrels, steel breech mechanism, or
the yellow metal training wheels of guns. Others
are cleaning rifles, which have recently been used
with special bullets for sinking floating mines.
One ship is washing down decks after coming in
late from night patrol; another is receiving its
three-monthly coat of grey paint; while on to the
deck of a whaler&mdash;black and ominous-looking&mdash;hundredweights
of provisions in boxes and bags
are being lowered from the quay.</p>

<p>Astern of these lie two tiers of light grey spick<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
and span motor launches, their decks spotlessly
white, and their small canvas and glass screened
wheel-houses ill concealing polished brass indicators,
Morse signalling key, electric switches, binnacles
and other paraphernalia. Behind these lie the
40-knot coastal motor boats, like miniature submarines,
with torpedoes in cavities in their aft
decks, and little glass-sheltered steering-wells.
Further towards the head of the pier is a line of
big flat Scotch motor drifters, built for rough
weather with 9-inch timbers, their decks a maze
of wire nets, glass floats and brick-red chemical
canisters.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the pier, in front of the
S.N.O.'s cabin, lies a big grey yacht with four 12-pounder
guns and an anti-aircraft weapon pointing
over the sky-reflecting water. Lying out in the
basin are big minesweepers, looking more like
pre-war third-class cruisers, two slim-looking dark
grey destroyers, a dredger and a few nondescript
craft.</p>

<p>Inside the first row of iron sheds are stores, with
barrels of tar, drums of paint, immense coils of
rope and a naval "William Whiteley's"&mdash;in which
anything from a looking-glass to a ball of string, or
a razor to a dish-cloth, can be obtained in exchange
for a signed form from the Naval Store Officer,
whose cabin near by is a maze of similar forms of
all colours.</p>

<p>Then a worried-looking man hurries by and the
O.O.D. smiles. "He's the coaling officer, and
there's some twenty ships waiting to get alongside<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
to take the beastly stuff aboard," is the laconic
explanation.</p>

<p>A cabin marked I.O. is entered&mdash;every room is
a cabin in a naval base. Here the walls are
decorated with innumerable charts with mysterious
red lines. A curious device, with the names of all
the ships belonging to the base painted on wooden
slides, reaches across one side. It is the indicator
which shows at a glance the ships at sea and those
in harbour, the names of those under repair, the
unit to which each vessel belongs and when she
goes out or comes in for "stand-off."</p>

<p>This is the Intelligence Office, and signals and
wireless messages from the patrols and battle fleets
are being almost continuously brought in and
carried out by messengers. The Commanding
Officer (C.O.) of a minesweeper is making inquiries
about tides and the exact position on the chart
of a newly located mine-field. Another officer is
locking a black patent-leather dispatch-case&mdash;he
is the King's Messenger or, more correctly, the
"Admiralty Dispatch Bearer," who carries to and
from London and the fleets all the secret correspondence
and memoranda of the Naval War Staff and
other important departments. A big safe in the
corner of the cabin contains the secret codes and
ciphers used when transmitting messages, and two
overworked officers are busy at near-by desks
translating signals to and from "plain English."</p>

<p>The next cabin contains the admiral's secretary
and his staff of writers. Here a flotilla commander
is receiving his "sailing orders," without which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
no ship proceeds on a voyage. Adjoining this is
the Pay Office, in which, with the exception of a
newly joined recruit mortgaging his pay for two
weeks ahead&mdash;he knows that he will be at sea for
that time&mdash;there is a decided air of quietude.
The rush in this abode of paymasters comes at the
end of each month, when all the officers arrive in a
body to demand the meagre fruits of their labours.</p>

<p>Sandwiched between the clean and varnished
cabin of the Base Commander, who is "taking"
defaulters, and the camp-bedded apartment of
the O.O.W. is a most interesting little combined
cabin and store, presided over by the Chaplain.
Here are piles of woollen socks, cardigans, balaclavas,
mitts and other clothes knitted by the
thoughtful women of the Empire for their sailor
sons. Here seamen are estimating the cold-resisting
qualities of different garments&mdash;for winter
in the North Sea is the next thing to Arctic exploration.
Officers are popping in and out to borrow
a pile of books&mdash;thrice blessed were the senders
of these donations. The corner of the cabin is
piled with fresh vegetables, but alas! the cry is
apples! No exhortations to righteousness adorn
the walls, and the chaplain is joking with a big
stoker who is distractedly turning over the
cardigans in search for one large enough to encompass
his massive frame. A signal boy slips in,
gets chocolate, gives a breathless thanks and slips
out just in time to avoid the playfully raised hand
of the P.O. of his ship. Two deck hands, covered
in coal dust, put their heads round the door to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
ask if they can have a bath, and the indefatigable
chaplain hands them the keys of the room provided
for the purpose by the generous.</p>

<p>Religion here is more practical than theoretical.
If a man swears when the "Padre" is present he
pays a small fine, which goes to the recreation or
other needy fund. The Commander is not immune
from this law at the base under review, and has
more than once been "heavily fined" for giving
his true opinion of German sailors and winter
weather.</p>

<p>The next cabin is that of the O.O.W., a seething
mass of officers demanding "duty boats" and
pinnaces to convey them to and from their ships
lying out in the fair-way. Others are expostulating
about being ordered to sea during their "stand-off,"
informing everyone what a rotten service the
navy is, crossing-sweeping is a sinecure compared
with it. Then a few pass on to the cabin near the
men's quarters. Here the "Drafting Officer" is
trying to palm off a deck hand on the C.O. of a
trawler, who is vainly explaining that he must
have a signalman. A telephone rings and news
comes from the "Sick Bay" that an engineer has
been badly burned and will be unable to go to sea
with his ship. The distracted drafting officer
searches through his lists of reserves for some
competent man to take the place of the casualty.</p>

<p>Peace reigns in the adjoining department, where
a grey-haired veteran is issuing charts, "Sailing
Directions," "Tide Tables" and "Warnings to
Mariners." In the near-by engineer-commander's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
office worried experts are wrestling with innumerable
problems relating to M.L. motors, steam
capstans, steam steering gear, electric dynamos,
damaged propellers, broken shafts, boiler cleaning
and the numerous imperfections of overworked
ships' engines.</p>

<p>The Boom Defence staff is placidly serene.
The turn of this department comes after a heavy
gale has damaged the submarine nets, chains and
buoys. The torpedo officers and their "parties"
are discussing the best way of moving four of these
steel monsters from a neighbouring dep&ocirc;t ship to
a new "Q" boat with only a rowing-boat at their
disposal&mdash;soon the O.O.W. will be called upon to
supply a drifter for the purpose.</p>

<p>In the ordnance store a veteran P.O. is trying to
make his list of returned brass shell-cases correspond
with the number of shells supplied to various
ships six months before. He knows the sailors'
fondness for shell-cases as ornaments in their little
far-away homes, and, failing to make all the figures
agree, decides that some <i>must</i> have been "washed
overboard."</p>

<p>The Port Minesweeping Officer is discussing with
his sea commanders the clearing of a new mine-field
laid by U-C-boats within the past few days, when
a sudden stir is caused by the arrival of a signal
from the wireless room to the effect that one of his
vessels has struck a mine in lat. &mdash;&mdash; long. &mdash;&mdash; and
is sinking. He appeals by telephone to the M.L.
commander and in less than ten minutes a flotilla
of fast launches is racing at 19 knots to the rescue.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">which collapse and leave a clear range for the guns</span>
</div>


<p>In the Admiral's cabin there is to be a conference
of senior officers later in the day to decide
on the best means of ridding the seas within that
area&mdash;and each base has its own area of sea&mdash;of a
hostile submarine which has been inflicting undue
loss upon shipping, its latest victim being a
Danish barque.</p>

<p>The combined wardroom and gunroom has
some twenty occupants, reading the newspapers
and magazines, warming themselves before the
two big fires, or talking in little groups. This base
has suffered some heavy losses lately, but reference
to those "gone aloft" is seldom made, except
quietly and a little awkwardly. The talk is of
theatres in neighbouring towns, the respective
merits of certain types of ships and weapons, the
prospects of early leave, the dirty warfare of
"Fritz" or the "beauties" of the North Sea in
winter.</p>

<p>In this room all questions of rank and precedence
are more or less waived. There are, of course,
differences, especially when the wardroom, or abode
of senior officers, does duty also as a gunroom for
the juniors. But here there is camaraderie and an
absence of iron discipline, although a sub-lieutenant
would be extremely ill advised either to drop the
prefix "Sir" or to slap the Commander on the
back in an excess of joviality, relying on "neutral
territory" to save him from rebuke. It is, however,
no uncommon event to see all ranks of officers
engaged in a heated debate, or groups of juniors
laughing round the fire while their elders are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
vainly trying to concentrate their minds on the
latest Press dispatches. Games are played and
glasses clink merrily, but in a gunroom there is a
very strict limit as to both time and quantity,
though none regarding volume or discordance of
sound.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Passing on to the organisation of the flotillas
for sea, we find in this large base six minesweeping
units, two being composed of fast paddle sweepers
and four of trawlers. The former are used for
distant operations and comprise nine vessels.
They work in pairs, but the extra ship is available
to sink mines cut up by the sweeps of the others,
and to be immediately ready to beat off submarine
attacks.</p>

<p>The trawlers are engaged in sweeping <i>daily</i> the
approaches to the harbour and a recognised channel
up and down the coast. Their work overlaps with
that done by the ships belonging to the neighbouring
bases. In this way the "war channel," about
which more will be said later, was kept free of mines,
and afforded a safe route for ships from the Thames
to the Tyne, and in reality to the northernmost
limit of Scotland.</p>

<p>This important duty was seldom left unperformed
even for a day, except during fierce
gales. Often the discovery of a distant mine-field
caused many ships to be concentrated on
clearing it, and the number available for the
"routine sweeps" was consequently reduced, but
longer hours of this arduous and dangerous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
work made up the difference, and the work went
on in summer fog and winter snow for over four
years.</p>

<p>The anti-submarine patrols were composed of
five ships each, under the command of the senior
officer of the unit&mdash;frequently a lieutenant with
the responsibility of a captain. Their work lay
out on the wastes of sea lying between England
and Germany. It was seldom that the whole five
vessels of each unit cruised together, the usual
method being to scatter over the different "beats"
and rendezvous in a given latitude and longitude
at a specified time and date. They were usually
able to communicate with each other and with
the base on important matters by wireless. Their
periods at sea varied from ten days to three weeks,
with a four days' "stand off" when they came
into harbour. But of this time one day at least
was spent in coaling and provisioning the ship
ready for the next patrol. This ceaseless vigilance
on the grey-green seas of England's frontier was
seldom interrupted for more than a few days in
the year by impossible gales. Anything short of
literally mountainous seas did not prevent the
trawler patrols from riding out the storm carefully
battened down and with just sufficient speed to
keep head to sea.</p>

<p>The drifters were divided into patrol units, boom
defence flotillas and under-water or mine-net units.
Their work was thus more varied but equally as
arduous and risky, as the loss of 30 per cent. of the
entire fleet of over 1000 ships affords undeniable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
proof. The periods of sea duty were similar to
those of the trawlers.</p>

<p>The motor launches at each base had some
hundred square miles of sea to guard, and hunted
in fives. The rough weather these plucky little
ships endured in the open sea in mid-winter, the
intense cold&mdash;for there was no proper heating
appliance&mdash;and the state of perpetual wetness
made their duties among the most arduous in the
sea war. Later pages of true narrative will show
to the full the work of these gnats of the sea.</p>

<p>In addition to all these flotillas there were convoy
ships, whaler patrols, "Q" boats and a number of
special duty ships. The work of the former was
of the most exacting character, and left the crews
of these vessels but little time ashore. In the base
under review so arduous were the duties of the
convoy ships that it became a matter of self-congratulation
for patrol and sweeper officers and
men that their ships were not so employed, and
this by men who sailed submarine and mine infested
seas for an average of 270 days in each year!</p>

<p>It must not be assumed that when in harbour
there were no duties to be performed by either
officers or men of sea-going ships. They had, on the
contrary, to furnish anchor watches, shore sentries,
duty crews for emergency pickets, prisoner guards,
working and church parties, to attend drills, rifle
practice, gun practice and instructional parades.
The officers had similar shore duties to perform,
which left them little time to rest from the strain of
keeping watch and ward on the death-strewn seas.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>THE CONVOY SYSTEM</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Although</span> the convoy system was employed at
the beginning of the war for the transport of the
Imperial armies to France, and subsequently for
all the Allied troop movements overseas, it was
some three years later before it was extended to
the entire British Mercantile navy, on which the
United Kingdom depended for too many of the
necessities of civilised life.</div>

<p>The rapid development of submarine piracy,
however, compelled the Admiralty, early in the
year 1917, to resort to what was merely a new
form of the old system of protecting sea-borne
trade. This comprised the collection of all
merchant ships passing through the danger zones
into nondescript fleets, and the provision of light
cruisers, destroyers, torpedo-boats, trawlers and
occasionally (for coastal convoys) of patrol launches
to escort them. Certain types of aircraft were also
frequently used for observation and scouting
purposes.</p>

<p>Previous to the adoption of the convoy system
a merchantman, whether it was a fast-moving
liner or a sturdy but slow ocean tramp, <i>zigzagged</i>
through the danger zones with lights out and life-boats
ready. Many were the exciting runs made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
in this way, with shells ploughing up the water
around and torpedoes avoided only by the quick
use of the helm; but the courage of our merchant
seamen was of that indomitable character exhibited
now for over three centuries, since the days
of Drake, Hawkins, Raleigh and the other sea-dogs
of old.</p>

<p>But the danger zones grew wider as the radius
of action of newer and larger German submarines
increased. At last no waters were immune, from
the Arctic circle to the Equator, or from Heligoland
to New York.</p>

<p>The hour was one of extreme peril for the sea-divided
Empire. To lose several hundred ships,
with many thousands of lives and much-needed
cargoes of food and munitions, when the valiant
armies of civilisation were battling with the
Teuton hordes, was bad enough; but if the enemy
had been able, by casting aside the laws of humanity
and sea war, to compel British ships to remain in
harbour or meet certain destruction on the high
seas, the result could only have been the complete
failure of the Allied cause, the conquest of Europe
and the fall of the greatest political edifice since
Imperial Rome.</p>

<p>Between the world and these catastrophes,
however, stood the undefeated Mercantile Marine
and the Allied navies. Councils were held in the
historic rooms of Whitehall and the old convoy
system emerged from the archives of Nelson's day.
The commerce raiders were no longer the canvas-pressed
privateers of the sixteenth, seventeenth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and early eighteenth centuries, who fought a clean
fight, often against great odds, but were submarine
pirates of the mechanical age, who only appeared
from the sea depths when their victims had been
placed <i>hors de combat</i>.</p>

<p>It is an old axiom of war that new weapons
of attack are invariably met by new methods of
defence. So it was with the convoy system which
gave the death-blow to German hopes of a submarine
victory. In order to understand this <i>new</i>
method it is necessary to study the accompanying
diagram, which, however simple it may appear on
paper, is extremely difficult to carry out in practice.</p>

<p>At each great port there was a convoy officer,
who assembled the merchant ships when they had
been loaded and explained to their captains the
exact position each ship was to occupy when the
fleet was at sea. Printed instructions were handed
round urging each vessel to keep its correct station,
stating the procedure to be adopted in the event
of an engine breakdown, giving the man[oe]uvres
which were instantly to be carried into effect when
an attack was threatened, and finally the special
signals arranged for communication between the
merchantmen and their escort by day and by
night.</p>

<p>The number of vessels composing a convoy
varied, but often exceeded twenty big cargo ships,
carrying some 120,000 tons of merchandise, or six
liners, with 20,000 troops on board, while the escorting
flotilla consisted of a light cruiser, acting as
flag-ship, six destroyers, two special vessels ("P"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
boats) towing observation airships, and some eight
or ten trawlers, with possibly one or more seaplanes
and several M.L.'s for the first few miles of the
voyage. The destroyers were spread out ahead
and on the flanks of the fleet, and by using their
greatly superior speed were able to zigzag and
circle round the whole convoy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 378px;">
<a href="images/i-140-big.jpg"><img src="images/i-140.jpg" width="378" height="400" alt="Fig. 18.&mdash;Diagram showing the disposition of a convoy of troops, munitions or food." title="" /></a>
</div>

<div class='hang1'><b><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 18.&mdash;Diagram showing the disposition of a convoy of troops,
munitions or food.</b></div>

<p>In the event of an attack the whole fleet turned
off from the course they were steering at a sharp<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
angle, showing only their sterns to the U-boat. A
destroyer acted as rearguard to prevent any of the
convoyed ships from straggling. When the fleet
had arrived at a rendezvous far out in the open sea,
where the danger of a submarine attack was much
less, the escort handed over their charges to one or
two ocean-going cruisers, which stayed with the
merchant ships throughout the remainder of their
voyage.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i-142.jpg" width="600" height="422" alt="A Motor Launch Cleared for Action" title="" />
<div class='attrib'><i>Yachting Monthly</i></div>
<span class="caption">A Motor Launch Cleared for Action</span>
</div>


<p>The escorting flotilla then cruised about in the
vicinity of the rendezvous until an incoming convoy
appeared. These ships were then taken over
from their mid-ocean cruiser guard and escorted
back through the danger zone to port, and so the
game of war continued until months became years.</p>

<p>All this may sound straightforward and quite
simple, but there were difficulties, to say nothing of
dangers, which made it a most arduous operation.
First came the speed problem. Every merchant
ship differed in this important respect, so the speed
of the slowest unit became the speed of the entire
fleet, and this reduction made an attack by under-water
craft much easier of accomplishment. Hence
the call for "standard ships," which is a point that
should be borne in mind by future generations
as a safeguard against blockade. Then came
the question of destination, which increased the
number of escorting flotillas, and especially ocean
cruiser guards, required for a given number of cargo
ships. Next there was the loading and unloading
to be considered, involving long hours and hard
work by the men on the quaysides. This great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
difficulty was one of the reasons for the formation
of docker battalions. Coaling such big fleets by
given times caused many grey hairs to appear
where otherwise they would not have been.
Finally there was the danger of mines having been
laid in the fair-ways leading to the port, which
necessitated every convoy being met by special
vessels to sweep the seas in front of each incoming
and outgoing fleet.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<a href="images/i-144-big.jpg"><img src="images/i-144.jpg" width="450" height="350" alt="Fig. 19.&mdash;Diagram showing the convoy system." title="" /></a>
</div>

<div class='hang1'><b><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 19.&mdash;Diagram showing the convoy system.</b></div>

<p>All this and more had to be contended with and
overcome before each convoy was able to sail.
Then danger and difficulty came hand-in-hand.
On a bright morning, with probably a fresh breeze
blowing and a choppy sea, the work of the escorting
flotilla was easy, but with such climatic conditions
the risk of attack was so great in the waters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
around the coasts that troopships usually left
harbour under cover of night. No lights were
then allowed, and it will not be difficult for readers
to imagine what it meant to be pounding through
a black void in a fast-moving destroyer, against,
possibly, a heavy head sea, with some twenty or
thirty big ships in the darkness and spray around.
Thick sea-mists were the cause of endless trouble,
for the safety of an invisible fleet depended on
the vigilance of a half-blind escort. Winter gales
scattered the ships and rendered signals invisible.
Attacks came from the most unexpected quarters
and often from more than one point of the compass
at the same time. However, relief came at last,
on that never-to-be-forgotten morning when Sir
David Beatty and his admirals accepted the
unconditional surrender of the German fleet and
its unsunk submarines.</p>

<p>Were this chapter to end with the foregoing
description of the convoy system the reader would
not be in possession of the full facts from which to
gauge the importance of the work. Something
must be said of what was accomplished. First in
order of importance came the transport of many
millions of soldiers not only from England to
France, but also to and from every colony and
dominion of the world-wide Empire. By August,
1915, the British navy had transported, across seas
infested with submarines and mines, a million men
without the loss of a single life or a single troopship.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
The first Canadian army of 33,000 men crossed the
Atlantic in one big fleet of forty liners, under the
escort of four cruisers and a battleship, in October,
1914, without accident. Transports to the number
of 60 were required to convey the first Australian
army over the 14,000 miles of sea to Europe, and it
was while convoying this huge fleet that the cruiser
<i>Sydney</i> chased and destroyed the German raider
<i>Emden</i>. The Russian force which rendered valuable
service in France was safely convoyed over
the 9000 miles of sea from Dalny to Marseilles.
Never once during the four and a half years of war
was the supply of food, munitions and reinforcements,
or the return of the wounded&mdash;to and from
the many theatres of land operations&mdash;seriously
hindered by the German, Austrian or Turkish
navies.</p>

<p>Turning to the gigantic task of guarding
England's food supply, we find, in one notable case,
an example of the good work performed almost
daily for nearly five years. Over 4500 merchant
ships had been escorted across the North Sea to
Scandinavian ports alone before the disaster of
14th October 1917 befell the convoy on that route.
On that occasion the anti-submarine escort of
three destroyers were intercepted, midway between
the Shetland Islands and Norway, by two heavily
armed German cruisers. The destroyers fought
to the last to save their charges, but unfortunately
only three merchant ships succeeded in getting
safely away. Five Norwegian ships, three Swedish
and one Danish ship were sunk. From this it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
will be observed that not only British merchantmen
were protected by escorts.</p>

<p>The second attack on the Scandinavian convoy
occurred on 12th December. The escort consisted
of two destroyers, the <i>Partridge</i> and <i>Pellew</i>, with
four armed trawlers. Fortunately the convoy
was comparatively a small one, for it was attacked
and almost totally destroyed in the North Sea by
four of the largest German destroyers. H.M.S.
<i>Pellew</i>, although badly damaged, succeeded in
returning to England.</p>

<p>It may be rightly thought that in both these
cases the escorting flotilla was not strong enough,
but it should be remembered that if heavier ships
had been employed they would have been much
less able to cope with a submarine attack. The
escort in both cases was purely an anti-submarine
defence, and only on the Scandinavian and Netherlands
routes was a surface attack at all possible,
because all exits from the North Sea were securely
closed by the strategic positions occupied by the
Grand Fleet and the battle cruiser squadrons, in
conjunction with subsidiary fleets at Harwich and
extensive mine-fields.</p>

<p>When it became apparent that surface as well
as submarine attacks on the North Sea convoys had
to be provided against, other means were promptly
adopted, and no further disasters occurred.</p>

<p>The strong escort accompanying the transports
bringing to Europe the first American army were
attacked at night by a submarine, but succeeded in
avoiding the torpedoes fired. This was due to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
smartness with which the United States warships
were man[oe]uvred. Three subsequent attacks on
the same convoy route also failed.</p>

<p>The Report of the War Cabinet for the year 1917
gives some remarkable figures in support of the
convoy system. On the Atlantic routes about
90 per cent. of the ships were formed into fleets and
escorted. From the inauguration of this system
the loss on these routes from all causes was 0<sup><big>.</big></sup>82
per cent., and if all the trade routes to and from
the United Kingdom are included, the loss was
only 0<sup>.</sup>58 per cent. With these figures in mind,
who will deny that the navy is the surest form of
national as well as Imperial insurance?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>THE MYSTERIES OF SUBMARINE HUNTING
EXPLAINED</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">When</span> all is said and done, anti-submarine warfare
is very like big-game hunting. Success depends
entirely on the initiative, skill and resource of the
individual hunter. Contrary to general belief,
there is, at present, no sovereign remedy for the
depredations of under-water craft with their
torpedoes and mines. There are, however, several
recognised methods of attack and defence employed
by surface ships in this newest form of
naval warfare.</div>

<p>When the new navy took the seas in 1914-1915,
bases were established not only round the coasts
of the British Isles, but also in the more distant
seas. The principal danger zones were, however,
the North Sea, the English Channel, the Irish Sea,
the Mediterranean and the eastern portion of the
North Atlantic. It was through these waters that
every hostile submarine must pass on its voyage
out and home.</p>

<p>This geographical factor restricted the theatre of
major operations to some 180,000 square miles of
sea. Minor offensive measures might have to be
adopted against individual U-boats cruising at
long distances from their bases, as actually occurred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
off the United States coast, but the fact of Germany
possessing large submarine bases only along her
own North Sea coast, and temporary ones on the
Flanders littoral, enabled a concentration of Allied
anti-submarine craft to be made in the narrow seas
which afforded the only means of entry and exit to
and from those bases.</p>

<p>The same may be said of Austria in the Adriatic
and of Turkey behind the Dardanelles.</p>

<p>This favourable combination of circumstances
would not occur if (however unthinkable) England,
France or the United States were ever to wage a
rigorous war against shipping. The large number
of oversea naval bases possessed by these Powers
would cause every sea to become a danger zone
within a few hours of the commencement of
hostilities. No effective concentration of hostile
surface craft would be possible with the zone of
operations spread over the water surface of the
entire globe, and if the bases themselves were
secured by predominant battle fleets, or numbers
of heavily armed monitors, the seas would quickly
become impossible for purposes of hostile transport.</p>

<p>This geographical restriction of the German and
Austrian danger zones made effective concentration
of the Allied anti-submarine fleets and their
devices possible. The 180,000 square miles of sea,
forming the theatre of major operations, was, on
special charts, divided into areas, comprising a few
hundred square miles of sea. Each area was given
a distinctive number, and a base was established
for its own patrol and minesweeping fleet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>The areas themselves were again subdivided on
special charts into squares or sections. Each
square covered a few leagues of sea and was
known by an alphabetical sign. In this way the
waters of the submarine danger zone were divided
into areas, with their bases and protective fleets, and
squares with their respective squadrons or ships.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">
<a href="images/i-151-big.jpg"><img src="images/i-151.jpg" width="425" height="395" alt="Fig. 20.&mdash;Diagram showing division of sea into anti-submarine patrol areas." title="" /></a>
</div>
<div class='hang1'><b><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 20.&mdash;Diagram showing division of sea into anti-submarine patrol areas.</b></div>

<p>Each square of sea was covered once or twice
daily by its own patrol ship or flotilla. Where the
danger was less the patrol was not so frequent
and the squares were almost indefinite in size, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
where the chances of successful operations were
exceptional, as in the Straits of Dover, additional
offensive measures were employed (see under <i><a href="#Mine_Barrage">Mine
Barrages</a></i>).</p>

<p>This, then, was the chess-board on which the
game of submarine warfare was played. To
facilitate communication between the different
patrols spread over the squares of sea, wireless
was fitted in many ships, and war signal stations
were erected on prominent points of land. Each
base was able to communicate by wireless with
any of its ships out on patrol duty, and was also
connected by land-line telegraph, telephone and
wireless with <i>naval centres</i>.</p>

<p>These latter were head intelligence offices,
usually situated at the great bases of the battle
fleets. In this way any concentration of hostile
surface warships noticed by the patrols (sometimes
submarines were employed, especially in the
Heligoland Bight) could be communicated in a few
minutes to the admirals commanding the Grand
Fleet, the Battle Cruiser Squadron or other large
fighting organisations.</p>

<p>At the naval centres the movements of hostile
submarines were recorded on charts. If, for
example, it was reported from a patrol boat that
the U16 had torpedoed a ship in square "C,"
area 41, at 10 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> (G.M.T.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>) on 4th August, and
the patrol had arrived on the scene too late to be
of any service, a warning could be wirelessed to
hundreds of vessels on the seas surrounding the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
scene of outrage to keep a careful look-out for the
U16.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">

sea would be covered daily by one or more ships of each unit.

way. The "Outer Beat" is shown by the arrows <i>C</i>, and the
"Inner Beat" by the arrows <i>D</i>. The points <i>+F</i> show the

<p>Subsequently a further message might come to
the naval centre that the same submarine had been
chasing a merchantman in square "D," "E" or
"F" in the adjoining area. A concentration<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
of fast ships, such as destroyers, M.L.'s or coastal
motor boats, could then be made so as to intercept
the raider or enclose her in a circle while other
vessels hunted her down.</p>

<p>In a like manner important convoys coming
down the coast, or entering a danger zone from
the open sea, could be met by a local flotilla and
escorted to a <i>rendezvous</i> with a flotilla from the
adjoining area. In this way they were passed
through the submarine and mine infested seas to
and from their harbour terminus.</p>

<p>Almost the same methods were employed in
dealing with the thousands of German mines.
But to describe that part of anti-submarine warfare
here would be to encroach on the subject of a
succeeding chapter.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Patrols</span></div>

<p>The <i>method</i> of patrolling the areas and squares
of sea was comparatively simple, though the same
cannot be said of the actual work. The lines of
patrol were called "beats," and there was usually
an "inner" and an "outer" beat for each unit or
flotilla of ships. If when a ship (or a unit) reached
her allotted square, from which the line of patrol
extended, she elected to proceed on the <i>inner beat</i>,
she would generally accomplish the return journey
to the point of departure on the <i>outer beat</i>, thus
covering her respective zone of patrol, but leaving
the exact route to the discretion of the commanding
officer. In this way no hostile submarine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
with a knowledge of the system could be sure of
when or where a patrol ship would be met. In the
same way it was left to the commander of a flotilla
to either divide his ships into pairs, single units, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
to maintain them as a homogeneous fleet, so that
any combination of hostile submarines could not
be made which would be sure of being able to
attack a <i>single</i> patrol. Such an enemy combination
might encounter a single ship, but it might also
walk into the arms of a whole flotilla; or it might
attack a single ship only to find itself surrounded
by a following fleet.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class='hang1'><b><span class="smcap"><a name="Fig_22" id="Fig_22"></a>Fig. 22.</span>&mdash;Diagram illustrating the operations of a hydrophone
flotilla composed of armed motor launches. Each vessel is given
a number, and the flotilla proceeds in line-abreast along the
course shown by the dotted lines. Each vessel is one mile
from the other, and the whole line stops by signal at the point
marked with a cross. Hydrophones are put in operation, and
after a period of listening the flotilla continues on its course, as
no submarine sounds are heard. The flotilla turns to head
south, and a stop is again made to listen on the hydrophones.
This time the sound of a hostile submarine is heard by vessel
No. 1, bearing S.W. This report is confirmed by vessel
No. 2 hearing the same sound, bearing a few degrees farther
W. The two bearings <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are then drawn on a chart, and
the point where the two lines cross is the approximate position
of the invisible submarine. The attack with depth charges
is then ordered.</b></div>

<p>The beats which were most distant from the base
were given to the largest ships. This was done
because it was often impossible for the more
distant patrols to reach a place of shelter before
one of the fierce gales which swept the northern
seas was upon them. Trawlers, large steam
yachts and converted merchantmen were usually
employed on squares more than one hundred miles
distant from a harbour of refuge, while motor
launches kept watch and ward on the seas closer
inshore.</p>

<p>The duration of patrols varied according to their
position. Some lasted three weeks and others
only a few days or hours. When the ships returned
to their base after a spell at sea they were
given a corresponding "rest" in harbour. A
three weeks' patrol meant several days' "stand-off,"
while a two or three days' patrol entitled the
ship to twenty-four hours in the comparative
comfort of a harbour.</p>

<p>It must not be imagined, however, that a stand-off
meant entire idleness or thorough rest. There
were duties to perform which robbed it of much
that it was intended to give. Ships had to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
coaled, provisioned, painted or repaired. Engines
had to be overhauled, sentries posted ashore,
a guard to be furnished, and every day one ship in
each unit that was in harbour had to be manned
and in readiness for emergencies.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Hydrophone Flotillas</span></div>

<p>We now come to the actual methods employed
by surface craft when attacking submarines.
Although, as previously stated, much was left to
individual initiative, there were, nevertheless,
certain recognised methods.</p>

<p>Taking as an example the operations of a hydrophone
flotilla of armed motor launches, the number
of vessels forming the unit was usually five. When
out scouting for the enemy they proceeded in line-abreast
for about one sea mile, then stopped their
engines and listened on their hydrophones for the
noise of a submarine cruising in the vicinity. If
nothing was heard the mile-long line of miniature
warships advanced another mile and again stopped
to listen. This man[oe]uvre was repeated until one
or other of the ships heard the familiar sound of a
U-boat. Nothing might be visible on the surface
of the sea, but if this was the case and the noise
came up from the ocean depths over the electrified
wires of the detector, it was conclusive proof that
a submarine was in the near vicinity.</p>

<p>The M.L. first detecting the noise hoisted a
signal (flag by day and coloured electric light by
night), giving the direction from which the sound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
came (see <a href="#Fig_22">Fig. 22</a>). The next ship in the line to
receive the sound on its instruments then hoisted
a signal, also giving the bearing&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> N.N.W.,
E.S.E., etc. If the two coincided in regard to
direction, the attack commenced. If, however,
they did not agree in this important respect, the
line of patrol ships advanced another mile and
listened again.</p>

<p>The flag-ship of the unit on receiving the direction
from one or more ships marked the lines of
sound on a chart (as in Fig. 22), and when this was
substantiated by another ship the point where the
two lines crossed was known to be the position of
the hostile submarine, and the attack was ordered.</p>

<p>As to the exact method of an anti-submarine
attack little need be said here beyond the fact that
the ships advanced at full speed, man[oe]uvring
into a special formation which enabled them to
cover about half a square mile of sea with the
explosive force of their collective depth charges.</p>

<p>When the attack had been completed all vessels
engaged resumed their stations and waited with
quick-firing guns ready in case the monster should
rise from the deep to make a dying effort to destroy
her pursuers.</p>

<p>The tactical methods of anti-submarine attack
were, of course, numerous, and they varied according
to the speed of the surface ships engaged.
What was possible of accomplishment by fast-moving
coastal motor boats or the larger-sized
M.L.'s proved impracticable for the more heavily
armed but slow-moving trawlers and drifters. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
tactics of these latter craft were often of the
simplest character, and consisted principally of
either independent attacks with the aid of hydrophones
and depth charges, or, more frequently, the
assumption of an innocent air in order to induce
the submarine to open the attack at close range.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a href="images/i-160-big.jpg"><img src="images/i-160.jpg" width="600" height="366" alt="The Result of a Direct Hit" title="" /></a>
<div class='attrib'><i>Thornycroft &amp; Co., Ltd.</i></div>
<span class="caption">The Result of a Direct Hit</span><br />A photograph left by the Germans in Ostend showing a coastal motor boat washed ashore after the great raid.
</div>



<p>In many respects this proved the most effective
method of anti-submarine warfare. Not only did
it frequently cause the under-water craft to rise to
the surface and commence the attack by gun-fire,
in order not to expend a valuable torpedo on what
appeared to be an unarmed and helpless ship, but
it also produced a <i>moral</i> effect throughout the
German submarine flotillas.</p>

<p>When a few U-boats had been either sunk or
damaged in this way the news that every Allied
ship was heavily armed circulated among the
enemy personnel, and they became very nervous
of attacking in any position except totally submerged.
This meant the loss of at least one
torpedo, out of from five to ten carried, for every
attack made, whether successful or unsuccessful,
and the latter were predominant.</p>

<p>It soon became apparent that either they must
risk surface attacks and so save their torpedoes,
or else curtail their cruises to meet the rapid expenditure
of their only submarine weapon. This
does not, of course, cover the activities of under-water
mine-layers, whose nefarious purpose consisted
simply of laying their mines wherever they
appeared most likely to catch Allied shipping.
These craft were usually armed with torpedoes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
as well as mines, to enable them to continue the
work of destruction when the cargo of the latter had
been safely laid. In this way the problem of combating
the German submarine offensive resolved
itself into two parts, one being to checkmate the
commerce raider and the other the mine-layer.
With the second of these difficulties we shall deal
in a later chapter.</p>

<p>Many merchantmen, both Allied and neutral,
owed their escape to this camouflage warfare,
which was brought to a high pitch of perfection
and daring in the now famous mystery ships.</p>

<p>What may be said to form the second method of
anti-submarine warfare was the decoy or camouflage
system. Of primary importance in this
category were the mystery ships already described,
but there were also innumerable other <i>ruses de
guerre</i> which increased its efficiency.</p>

<p>To describe one of these will enable the reader to
draw on his own imagination for the remainder. A
vessel was steaming in from the Atlantic and was
about a hundred miles from the Cornish coast when
she was attacked by a submarine above water.
The surface ship was heavily armed, but instead of
using her weapons at once she sent out frantic
wireless signals for assistance. Every few minutes
the call went far and wide in plain Morse.</p>

<p>The shells from the submarine splashed into the
sea around, but none struck the target for some
minutes. Had the surface ship desired, she could
in all probability have avoided the under-water
craft by using her superior speed, but instead she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
dropped back, allowing the submarine to catch up
to her, and the shells began to burst unpleasantly
close.</p>

<p>Still the frantic wireless calls went forth. First
the simple message: "I am being attacked by a
large German submarine." Then the vehemence
increased to: "I am being heavily shelled."
A few minutes elapsed and then the call:
"Help. Submarine gaining on me." And finally:
"Abandoning ship."</p>

<p>At this point the submarine was close astern and
the liner slowing down preparatory to lowering her
life-boats. The shells were damaging her superstructure,
but a heavy swell interfered with the
German marksmanship. Then came the surprise.
A life-boat on the liner's poop was hoisted clear of
the deck and from under its cover there appeared
the lean grey muzzle of a 4<sup>.</sup>7-inch gun. A few
sharp blasts of cordite and the submarine sagged
and disappeared.</p>

<p>The captain of the liner had noticed when first
attacked that the submarine was fitted with wireless
and the calls sent out by him were in <i>plain
Morse code</i>. On the strength of these the German
commander had saved his torpedoes but lost his
ship.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Another form of anti-submarine tactics was the
employment of indicator and mined nets around
an apparently disabled ship, or in lines across
narrow channels known to be used by German submarines
on their way to and from their bases. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
method has, however, received full mention in other
chapters.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>What may be termed the third system of anti-submarine
warfare was the use of extensive mine
barriers, specially laid to catch submarines
attempting to pass through them under water.
The surface of the sea was patrolled by shallow-draft
vessels and the under-seas guarded by mines.
If a submarine was sighted in the vicinity of one
of the mine barriers already described she was
attacked and forced to submerge herself in order
to escape destruction from the guns of the pursuing
surface flotilla. From that moment her fate was
sealed. By cautious man[oe]uvring and using to
full advantage their great superiority of speed
(20-40 knots against 6-10 knots) the surface ships
were able to head their quarry into the mine-field.
Usually the submarine dived deep in order to
throw her pursuers off the track, and all unconscious
of the deep-laid mines in thousands she
plunged to her doom&mdash;a heavy rumble, followed by
an upheaval of the surface, and the chase was over.</p>

<p>This method, when carried out on the vast and
scientifically sound principle described in a previous
chapter, offers the best possible antidote
to the submarine. Its employment in the Great
European War placed the seal of complete success
on the Allied anti-submarine offensive. It should,
however, be remembered that comparatively
narrow seas and a restricted zone of major operations
made possible of accomplishment with some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
hundreds of thousands of mines (average cost,
&pound;400) what would in many cases and in many
seas have been quite impracticable with as many
millions of these difficult weapons.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The employment of submarines against submarines
also forms a method of under-sea warfare
which gives considerable scope for both daring
and resource. It is of course quite impossible for
one of these vessels when totally submerged to
fight another in the same blind condition. But
with just the small periscopic tube&mdash;or eye of
the submarine&mdash;projecting above the surface, one
craft can scout and watch for another to rise to
the surface, thinking no enemy is near, in order
to replenish her air supply for breathing or for
recharging the electric storage batteries which
supply the current for submerged propulsion.</p>

<p>When such a position obtains the submarine
which comes unknowingly to the surface stands a
grave danger of being torpedoed by her opponent.
This actually occurred to at least one German
U-boat during the Great War.</p>

<p>One or more submarines can also be employed
around a slow-moving decoy ship. In this case
they would have the advantage of being invisible
until the actual moment of attack. The result of
such a man[oe]uvre would be either a gun duel on
the surface or the torpedoing of the attacking
submarine by one or other vessel of the decoy's
submerged escort.</p>

<p>It was a ruse of this kind which achieved success<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
in the North Sea during the early stages of the war.
A trawler was employed to tow a submarine by a
submerged hawser. This mode of progress was
adopted to enable the submarine to economise the
strictly limited supply of electricity carried for
under-water propulsion.</p>

<p>The trawler then cruised very slowly about,
dragging the submarine under the surface behind
her. In order to divert any suspicion which might
have been aroused by her slow speed she was rigged
so as to give the impression that a net was being
towed, and the area of operations chosen was
well-known fishing-ground.</p>

<p>In this curious way days were spent before the
desired consummation was reached. Then a large
U-boat came boldly to the surface and opened fire.
Instantly the submarine astern of the trawler
was released from the tow rope and forged ahead
under her own electric engines. The commander
of the surface decoy stopped his ship and commenced
lowering the small life-boat carried. This
was done in order to distract the attention of
the Germans from the tiny periscope which was
planing through the water to the attack.</p>

<p>A shell struck the trawler, carrying away her
funnel, but did no other damage, and a few seconds
later the water around the U-boat rose up in a vast
upheaval of white. The plan had succeeded, and
when the air cleared of the smoke from the trawler's
damaged stack there was nothing afloat on the
surface of the sea around&mdash;except an ever-widening
patch of oil and bubbles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>A few minutes later the thin grey line of the
British submarine rose above the swell some
five hundred yards distant from the scene of her
triumph.</p>

<p>Another means by which one subaqueous fleet
can attack another is by laying mines in the seas
around the enemy base.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>These simple methods formed what may be
termed the backbone of the widespread anti-submarine
operations during the Great War, but with
the experience gained and the brains of almost
every nation focussed on the problem of providing
an effective counterblast to the under-water warship,
there can be little doubt that in the next
great naval conflict new and more scientific means
of attacking these pests of the sea will have been
perfected, though what degree of success they
will attain in the stern trial of war the future
alone can tell.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>THE MYSTERIES OF GERMAN MINE-LAYING
EXPLAINED</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">To</span> those unversed in modern war it may have
appeared strange that, although the Allied navies
held command of the sea from the opening of the
Great War in 1914 to the signature of Peace in
1919, the Germans were nevertheless able to lay
several thousand mines every year off the coasts
of England, France and even the most distant
colonies and dominions. It often occurred that
harbour entrances and narrow fair-ways were repeatedly
mined, notwithstanding a vigilant day-and-night
watch from the bridges, look-outs and
decks of many patrol ships cruising or listening in
the vicinity.</div>

<p>The explanation is that the mines were laid by
large submarines capable of approaching the coast,
laying their deadly cargo from specially constructed
stern tubes and retreating to comparative
safety far out in the broad ocean, without
rising more than momentarily to the surface for
the purpose of observation.</p>




<p>This, it may be said, did not absolve the ships
listening on their hydrophones, who should have
been able to detect the approach of a submarine
from the sound of her engines. During the first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
year of war the hydrophone was a very imperfect
instrument, and although the sound might be
heard it was quite impossible to tell from what
direction it was coming. Later on, when the
listening appliances had been greatly improved,
there still remained two detrimental factors. The
noise of breakers beating against rocks, sands or
other obstructions destroyed much of the value of
these instruments when used close inshore. On
dark and rough nights the roar of wind and sea
and the lurching of the vessel rendered subaqueous
sounds extremely difficult to detect; and in a fair-way
or channel used by surface shipping it was
frequently impossible, even in fine but dark
weather, to tell if the sound coming up from the
sea emanated from a surface ship or a submarine.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 387px;">
<a href="images/i-170-big.jpg"><img src="images/i-170.jpg" width="387" height="600" alt="A Captive Mine-laying Submarine" title="" /></a>
<div class='attrib'><i>Sport and General</i></div><span class="caption">A Captive Mine-laying Submarine</span><br />U.C. 5 off Temple Pier, London.
</div>
<p>If, in the latter case, the patrol ship started her
own engines and moved forward in the darkness to
ascertain from whence the noise came, she gave
away her presence to the hostile submarine, <i>also
fitted with listening appliances</i>. Whereas if she remained
still and waited for the enemy to approach,
mines might be laid in the meantime across important
fair-ways which it was her duty to guard.</p>

<p>German mine-laying submarines were designated
U-C boats, and often these vessels would employ
a ruse in order to lay their mines in safety. Sometimes
a decoy would draw the patrols away on a
fruitless chase while the mines were being launched
from the tubes of another U-C boat. In one case
a big armed steamer was attacked with torpedoes
while mines were being laid across the line of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
advance by which a flotilla of warships would be
likely to come out to her aid from a near-by base.</p>

<p>In these and other ways over 3000 mines were
laid off the British coast in one year. There
were also several raids by surface mine-layers,
which succeeded in eluding the network of patrols
in the fogs and snows which prevail in the
North Sea during several months out of every
twelve. The two most important of these were the
cruises of the <i>Wolfe</i> and the <i>Moewe</i>. The former
vessel left Germany during the November fogs of
1916, and, by skirting the Norwegian coast, succeeded
in passing the British patrol flotillas. She
carried 500 mines, and after crossing the North Sea
in high latitudes, proceeded down the mid-Atlantic
until off the Cape of Good Hope, where the first
mine-field was laid. She then crossed the Indian
Ocean, laying fields off Bombay and Colombo.</p>

<p>It was in these seas that she succeeded in capturing
a British merchantman. Placing a German
crew and a cargo of mines aboard, she sent the
prize to lay a field off Aden, while she herself
proceeded to New Zealand. In these far-distant
waters another field was laid, and a few months
later the last of her cargo was discharged off
Singapore. From this time onward she became a
commerce raider.</p>

a favourable opportunity to approach the British
coast. This came one wild January night with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
rising gale and a haze of snow. All her mines,
about 400 in number, were laid off the Scottish
coast in the teeth of a nor'wester. Then, with the
"jolly Roger at the fore," she steamed out on to
the wastes of sea lying between the New World
and the Old.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<div class='hang1'><b><span class="smcap"><a name="Fig_24" id="Fig_24"></a>Fig. 24.</span>&mdash;Diagram illustrating the effect of tide on a moored mine.
A vessel is approaching a mine <i>D</i>, moored to the bottom by a
sinker <i>H</i>. The distance from the top of the horns of the mine
to the surface of the sea is approximately 5 feet at low tide, and
as the vessel's draught is 7 feet she would strike the mine. If,
however, the same vessel passed over the same mine a few hours
later, at high tide, the level of the sea would have risen 5 feet,
and the mine would then be 10 feet below the surface; in
which case the ship would just pass over in safety. This is
known as the "tide difficulty." There is, in addition, the
"dip" of the mine due to the strength of the tidal current.
<i>E</i> and <i>F</i> show what is meant by the dip of a mine. It is the deflection
from the vertical caused by the ebb and flow of the tide.
It frequently causes a mine-field to be quite harmless to passing
surface craft except during the period of slack water between
tides.</b></div>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>We now come to the mines themselves and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
method of laying them both above and below the
surface.</p>

<p>A good idea of the shape, size and general
characteristics of these weapons will be obtained
from the accompanying diagrams. On being discharged
into the sea they automatically adjust
themselves to float about ten feet below the surface
(according to tide) and are anchored to the bottom
by means of a wire mooring rope attached to a
heavy sinker. To describe here the mechanical
details of all the different types of German submarine
mines would occupy many pages with uninteresting
technical formul&aelig;. It is sufficient to
say that they carried an explosive charge (200 to
400 lb. of T.N.T.) sufficient to blow to pieces
vessels of several hundred tons and to seriously
damage the largest warship. They were intended
to float a few feet below the surface&mdash;being held
down by the mooring rope&mdash;but, as there was no
means of compensating for the rise and fall of the
tide, many of them often showed their horns above
the surface at low water and were immersed too
deep to be of much use against any but the deepest
draught ships at high tide. A reference to Fig. 24
will make this difficulty clear.</p>

<p>There was scarcely a ship afloat in the zone of
operations which did not, during those years of
storm, sight one or more of these hateful weapons
with their horns showing above the surface. Motor
launches were employed to scout for them during
the hour before and the hour after low water. In
this way many hundreds were discovered and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
destroyed almost as soon as they had been laid.
One badly laid mine, which shows on the surface
when the tide ebbs, will often give away a whole
field of these otherwise invisible weapons, and the
work of sweeping them up and destroying them is
then rendered comparatively easy.</p>

<p>The effect of strong tides on a moored mine is considerable,
and will render a field quite harmless for
several hours out of every twenty-four. The reason
for this is best described with the aid of a diagram.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the above that the mine will
not remain vertically above its sinker when there
is a tide, but will incline at an angle determined by
the strength of the current, which, if considerable,
will press the weapon down much deeper than the
keel of any ship (see <a href="#Fig_24">Fig. 24</a>). When the tide
turns the mine will first regain its true perpendicular
position and then incline in the opposite
direction, accommodating itself to the ebb and
flow. From this it will be apparent that in places
where there is a strong current or tide a mine-field
is only dangerous to passing ships of shallow or
medium draft for a few hours (during slack water)
out of the twenty-four. Between the ebb and
the flow of a tide there is a short period when the
water is almost still. Then the movement begins
to set in from the opposite direction and gradually
gains in speed until about one hour before high or
low tide. This period of what is known as "slack
water" varies considerably in different places and
different weather conditions, but plays an important
part in all minesweeping operations.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>In this way many a ship has passed over a mine-field
all unconscious of the fate which would have
befallen her had she traversed the same area of sea
an hour or so earlier or later.</p>

<p>Mines which break adrift, or are laid without
moorings of any kind, are called <i>floating mines</i>.
The latter are a direct violation of International
Law, as they cannot be recovered when once they
have been laid, and become a danger to neutral as
well as to enemy shipping. The laws of civilised
warfare also require even a moored mine to be
fitted with some mechanical device which renders
it safe when once it has broken adrift from the
wire and heavy sinker which holds it in a stated
position. The reason for this humanitarian rule is
that neutrals can be warned not to approach a
given area of sea in which there are moored mines,
but if these weapons break adrift&mdash;as they frequently
do in heavy weather&mdash;and float all over
the oceans, they would seriously endanger the
lives and property of neutral states unless something
were done to render them innocuous.</p>

<p>The total disregard of all the laws and customs
of civilised warfare by the Germans in 1914-1919
has now been so well established that it seems
almost unnecessary to give yet another instance
of this callousness. In the case about to be quoted,
however, there is, as the reader will observe, an
almost superlative cunning.</p>

<p>Any cursory examination of a German moored
mine will show that there is a device fitted
ostensibly to ensure the weapon becoming safe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
when it breaks adrift from its moorings and thus
complying with The Hague Convention. For
several months after the outbreak of war it puzzled
many minesweeping officers and men why, with
this device fitted, every German <i>floating</i> or <i>drifting</i>
mine was dangerous. A few, relying on these
weapons being safe when adrift, had endeavoured
to salve one and had paid for the experiment with
the lives of themselves and their comrades. This
caused every mine, whether moored or adrift, to be
regarded by seamen as dangerous, notwithstanding
the oft-repeated assurances that German mines
fulfilled all International requirements in this
respect. Then a mine which had broken away
from its moorings was successfully salved, in face
of the great danger involved, and the truth came
out.</p>

<p>A device <i>was</i> fitted to render it safe, but, with
truly Hunnish ingenuity, the metal out of which
an essential part of this appliance was made was
quite unable to bear the strain imposed by its
work, and, to make doubly sure, another part was
half filed through. The result was that, instead of
rendering the mine safe when torn from its moorings
by rough seas, the essential parts broke and
left the mine fully <i>alive</i>.</p>

<p>Any discovery such as this&mdash;<i>only made at the
great risk of salving a live mine</i>&mdash;could be easily
explained away by German diplomacy as faulty
workmanship in a particular weapon, reliance
being placed on the fact that not many mines could
be salved in this way without heavy loss of life; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
numbers were recovered in spite of the dangers and
extraordinary difficulties of such operations, and
the guilt was for ever established in the minds of
those who sail the seas.</p>

<p>Little need be said here regarding the method of
laying mines from surface ships like the <i>Wolfe</i> and
<i>Moewe</i>. The weapons were arranged to run along
the decks on railway lines and roll off the stern, or
through a large port-hole, into the sea as the vessel
steamed along.</p>

<p>With submarine mine-layers or U-C boats the
method was, however, much more complicated
and needs full description. Each vessel was
fitted with large expulsion tubes in the stern
and carried some eighteen to twenty mines.
These weapons, although similar in their internal
mechanism to <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'he'">the</ins> ordinary mine, were specially
designed for expulsion from submerged tubes or
chambers.</p>

<p>The mines were stored in the stern compartment
of the submarine, between guide-rails fitted with
rollers. They were in two rows and moved easily
on the well-greased wheels. The loading was
accomplished through water-tight hatchways in
the deck above. In order to expel these mines
from the interior of the submarine when travelling
under the surface each weapon had to be moved
into a short expulsion tube or chamber, the inner
cap of which was closed when a mine was inside,
and the outer or sea-cap opened. A supply
of compressed air was then admitted into the
back of the tube and the mine forced out into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the open sea, in the same way as a torpedo is now
expelled from a submerged tube.</p>

<p>Before another mine could be launched the sea-cap
had to be closed, the water blown from the
tube, the inner cap opened and a second mine
placed ready in the chamber. This, however, did
not end the difficulty of laying mines from submarines.
The increase in the buoyancy of the
boat, due to the loss of weight as each mine was
discharged into the sea, had to be instantly and
automatically compensated by the admission of
quantities of sea-water of equal weight into special
tanks, hitherto empty, situated below the mine-tubes.
If this had been neglected the submarine
would have come quickly to the surface, stern
uppermost, owing to the lightening of the hull by
the expulsion therefrom of some fifteen weapons
weighing many hundreds of pounds each.</p>

<p>When the mine was clear of the submarine it
sank to the bottom, owing to the weight of the
sinker or anchor. After a short immersion, however,
a special device enabled the top half, containing
the charge of explosive and the contact firing
horns, to part company with the heavy lower half,
composed of the iron sinker and the reel of mooring
wire. The explosive section then floated up towards
the surface, unwinding the wire from the
sinker.</p>

<p>Each mine being set, before discharge, to a certain
prearranged depth (obtained by the captain
of the U-C boat either by sounding wires or from
special charts showing the depth of water in feet),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the weapon could not rise quite up to the surface,
being checked in its ascent, when ten feet from
the top, by the mooring wire refusing to unwind
farther.</p>

<p>This may sound a little involved, but a careful
study of the accompanying diagrams will make
the various movements of the mine and its sinker,
after leaving the submarine, quite clear to the lay
reader.</p>

<p>There were also other types of mines employed.
Some were fitted with an automatic device which
was actuated by the pressure of the water at a set
depth. These weapons could be expelled from
submarines without the necessity of knowing and
adjusting the depth at which they were to float
below the surface. A mine of this pattern rose up,
after discharge from the tube, until the pressure of
water on its casing was reduced to 4&frac12; lb. per
square inch (the pressure which obtains at a depth
of ten feet below the surface<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>), and there the
weapon stopped, waiting patiently for its prey.</p>

<p>Another kind of mine was of the floating variety&mdash;tabooed
by The Hague Convention&mdash;which
drifted along under the surface with no moorings
to hold it in one position.</p>

<p>Now that the reader is familiar with the mines
themselves and the actual methods of laying them,
we can pass on to a brief review of the German
mine-laying policy during the Great War.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>
<p>The submarine offensive reached its maximum
intensity in 1916-1917, during which period no less
than 7000 mines were destroyed by the British
navy alone.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Of this number about 2000 were drifting
when discovered. There was, with one small
exception, no portion of the coast of the United
Kingdom which was not mined at least once
during those eventful <i>two</i> years, the unmined area
being undoubtedly left clear to facilitate a raid or
invasion. About 200 minesweeping vessels were
blown up or seriously damaged, but the losses
among the Mercantile Marine were kept down to
less than 300 ships out of the 5000 sailings which,
on an average, took place weekly.</p>

<p>The heavy losses inflicted on the enemy's submarine
fleets in 1917 marked the turning of the
tide, and from that date onwards there was a
steady but sure reduction in the number of mines
laid.</p>

<p>During the first twelve months of the intensified
submarine war the Germans concentrated their
mine-laying on the food routes from the United
States, the sea communications of the Grand Fleet
off the east coast of Scotland and the line of supply
to France. Then, when they commenced to
realise the impossibility of starving the sea-girt
island, and the weight of the ever-increasing
British armies began to tell in the land war, the
submarine policy changed to conform with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
general strategy of the High Command, and the
troop convoy bases and routes were the objects of
special attack.</p>

<p>The arrival in Europe of the advance guard of the
United States army caused another change in the
submarine strategy. From that time onwards
the Atlantic routes assumed a fresh importance
and became the major zone of operations.</p>

<p>In the first year of the war the U-C boats discharged
their cargoes of mines as soon as they could
reach their respective areas of operation. The
mines were usually laid close together in one field,
frequently situated off some prominent headland,
or at a point where trade routes converged. Then
the enemy learned to respect the British minesweeping
and patrol organisation, and endeavoured
to lay their "sea-gulls' eggs" in waters which had
been recently swept, or where sweeping forces
appeared to be weak in numbers.</p>

<p>When this failed they played their last card,
scattering the mines in twos and threes over wide
areas of sea. To meet this new mode of attack
large numbers of shallow-draught M.L.'s were employed
to scout for the mines at low water.</p>

<p>It was about this time that the great Allied mine
barriers across the entrances and exits to and from
the North Sea were completed and the losses among
the U and U-C boats became heavy. A rapid
abatement in the submarine offensive soon became
apparent, and utter failure was only a matter of
time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>THE MYSTERIES OF MINESWEEPING
EXPLAINED</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> task which confronted the naval minesweeping
organisations in the years succeeding 4th August
1914 was an appalling one. Any square yard of
sea around the 1500 miles of coast-line of the British
Isles might be mined at any moment of any day
or night. There were, in addition, the widely
scattered fields laid by surface raiders like the
<i>Wolfe</i> and the <i>Moewe</i>, which, as described in a
previous chapter, extended their operations to
the uttermost ends of the earth. A wonderfully
efficient patrol of the danger zones had its effect
in reducing the number of submarine mine-layers
available to the enemy and in rendering both difficult
and hazardous the successful execution of their
work, but neither a predominant and subsequently
victorious fleet, nor an equally skilful and
alert patrol, could guarantee the immunity of any
considerable area of sea from mines.</div>

<p>The Germans laid many thousands of these
deadly and invisible weapons in the 140,000 square
miles of sea around the British Isles <i>alone</i> in the
face of over 2000 warships. To search for these
patches of death in the wastes of water may well
be likened to exploring for the proverbial "needle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
in a haystack." Yet the sweepers, whose sole
duty it was to fill this breach in the gigantic system
of Allied naval defence, explored daily and almost
hourly, for over four years, the vast ocean depths,
discovering and destroying some 7000 German
mines, with a loss of 200 vessels of their number.
The result of this silent victory over one of the
greatest perils that ever threatened the Sea Empire
was that some 5000 food, munition and troop ships
were able to enter and leave the ports of the United
Kingdom <i>weekly</i> with a remarkably small percentage
of loss from a peril which might easily have
proved disastrous to the entire Allied cause.</p>

<p>This, then, in broad outline, was the task which
confronted this section of the naval service, and its
successful accomplishment forged a big link in the
steel chain encompassing the glorious victory.</p>

<p>Before passing on to describe the ships and the
appliances used it is first necessary to give a more
detailed account of the operations generally included
under the heading of minesweeping. As it
was impossible to tell exactly where mines would
be laid from day to day, an immense area of sea
had to be covered by what was known as <i>exploratory
sweeping</i>. This consisted of many units of
ships emerging from the different anti-submarine
bases almost every day throughout the year and
proceeding to allotted areas of water, where they
commenced sweeping north, south, east or west, in
an endeavour to discover if the areas in question
were safe for mercantile traffic. If no mines were
discovered that particular area would be reported<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
safe, but if only one of these weapons was cut from
its mooring by a sweep-wire the area would be
closed to merchant ships until the sea around was
definitely cleared of the hidden danger. This
system of open and closed areas entailed an
enormous amount of efficient administrative staff
work apart from the actual sweeping, and its
success was partly dependent upon the vigilance
of the patrols employed to divert shipping from
dangerous patches of sea.</p>

<p>When a mine-field was discovered which interfered
with the free movement of a large number of
ships a big concentration of sweepers from all the
adjacent bases was ordered by telegraph and wireless.
The area was isolated by patrols and the
mines swept up. In one field no less than 300-400
mines were known to have been laid. Finally a
further exploratory sweep was made, and if nothing
further was discovered the area was again opened
to traffic, and the sweepers turned their attention
either to routine duties or to the clearance of
another field.</p>

<p>The entrance to every important harbour was
swept once or twice a day, and all convoys had
sweepers ahead of them when they left or entered
such confined waters. The seas adjacent to
harbours and naval bases were searched at low
water for mines which might be showing above the
surface. Around the anchorage of the Grand Fleet
in Scapa Flow a wide belt of sea was kept clear of
mines so that at any moment the fleet could
reach blue water without risk from these weapons.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
The same precautions were taken off the Firth
of Forth for the benefit of the battle cruisers,
and outside Harwich for Admiral Tyrwhitt's light
forces.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a href="images/i-188-big.jpg"><img src="images/i-188.jpg" width="600" height="325" alt="Model of a Coastal Motor Boat (55 ft.) with Torpedo and four Depth Charges" title="" /></a>
<div class='attrib'><i>Thornycroft &amp; Co., Ltd.</i></div>
<span class="caption">Model of a Coastal Motor Boat (55 ft.) with Torpedo and four Depth Charges</span>
</div>


<p>A passage known as the "war channel"&mdash;about
which more will be said later&mdash;extending
from the Downs to Newcastle, was swept daily
by relays of sweepers operating from the anti-submarine
bases along this 320 miles of coast-line.
This buoyed and guarded channel formed a line of
supply for the great fleets in the north.</p>

<p>Each big fighting formation was provided with
a special flotilla of fast fleet sweepers, which were
capable of clearing the seas ahead of the battleships
and cruisers moving at 20 knots. This was
a separate organisation to what may be described
as the routine sweeping of the trade routes. These
vessels were always within call of the fleets they
served.</p>

<p>It has been estimated that over 1000 square
miles of sea were swept daily by the anti-mine
fleets of the British navy during the four years of
war. This may not sound a very stupendous
figure compared with the area of the danger zone,
but in practice it necessitated terribly hard work
from dawn to dusk by several thousand ships and
many thousands of men in summer heat and winter
snow.</p>

<p>There was in addition to all this the clearing of
British mine-fields no longer required in the positions
in which they had been originally laid. This
was not entirely an after-the-war problem, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
although the great mine barriers were left until
peace was assured, there were fields of minor importance
which had to be cleared to meet new
situations as the years of war passed swiftly by.
A notable instance of this was the destruction of a
big field of some 400 mines off the Moray Firth.</p>

<p>The foregoing refers only to the minesweeping
in the principal danger zones in British waters, no
account being taken of the work carried out by
Allied vessels in the Mediterranean, off the coasts
of France, Italy, Greece, Gallipoli, and in such
distant seas as those washing the shores of New
Zealand, Australia, Hong-Kong, Japan, Singapore,
Bombay, Aden, the Cape of Good Hope, the United
States, Eastern Canada, West Africa and Arctic
Russia, in all of which mines were laid by surface
raiders like the <i>Wolfe</i>, and afterwards located and
cleared by Allied warships.</p>

<p>From the foregoing some idea of the gigantic
nature of the task will be obtained, and we can pass
on to a more detailed account of the actual work.
Minesweeping may be divided into eight well-defined
sections, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang1'>(1) <i>Fleet Sweeping.</i>&mdash;Keeping clear the sea routes of the battle fleet.</div>

<div class='hang1'>(2) <i>Exploratory Sweeping.</i>&mdash;Searching the sea for isolated groups or fields.</div>

<div class='hang1'>(3) <i>Routine Sweeping.</i>&mdash;The daily or weekly sweeping of areas, channels and coastal trade routes, largely used by shipping.</div>

<div class='hang1'>(4) <i>Clearing Large Mine-fields.</i>&mdash;Big concentrations of ships to rapidly clear important<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
routes temporarily blocked by large mine-fields.</div>

<div class='hang1'>(5) <i>Special Shallow-Water Sweeping.</i>&mdash;Such as that carried out off the Belgian coast by specially constructed shallow-draught ships, frequently with single-ship sweeps.</div>

<div class='hang1'>(6) <i>Convoy Sweeping.</i>&mdash;Precautionary sweeping in front of incoming and outgoing convoys. This was regularly done even if the fair-way was covered by routine sweeping.</div>

<div class='hang1'>(7) <i>Harbour Sweeping.</i>&mdash;Precautionary sweeping usually carried out by small craft at big naval bases such as Portsmouth (Spithead) and Rosyth (Firth of Forth) inside the submerged defences.</div>

<div class='hang1'>(8) <i>Searching at Low Tide.</i>&mdash;This was done by shallow-draught vessels of the M.L. type in order to locate badly laid mines which might project above the surface at low water. Several hundred were discovered in this way.</div>

<p>In order to carry out these duties efficiently the
heterogeneous fleet of minesweepers was divided
into small fleets stationed at the numerous anti-submarine
bases, and these were again subdivided
into units of ships especially adapted for the different
classes of work. Each <i>pair</i> of vessels had to
be more or less alike in size, draught, speed and
man[oe]uvring ability to enable them to work
efficiently in dual harness. Consequently there were
complete units of vessels specially constructed for
dealing rapidly with discovered mine-fields and for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
use with the battle fleets. Shallow-draught vessels
of the motor launch type for work in the shallow
water off the Belgian coast. Converted pleasure
steamers of the usual Thames, Mersey and Clyde
type for convoy sweeping. Motor launches for
clearing fair-ways and for searching at low water.
Flotillas of trawlers and drifters for the hard and
monotonous routine sweeping on the important
coastal trade routes. They comprised in all several
thousand ships engaged solely on this work.</p>

<p>At each important base there was a Port Minesweeping
Officer (P.M.S.O.), with one or more assistants,
whose duty it was to administer, under the
command of the S.N.O., the fleets in the attached
area, and to furnish preliminary telegraphic and
detailed reports to the Minesweeping Staff at the
Admiralty, who issued a confidential bi-monthly
publication to all commanding officers which was
a veritable encyclop&aelig;dia of valuable information
regarding current operations, events and enemy
tactics. Attached to this department was a section
of the Naval School of Submarine Mining,
Portsmouth, where all knotty problems were unravelled
and appliances devised to meet all kinds
of emergencies.</p>

<p>Each unit of ships was under the command of
a senior officer, responsible for the operations of
these vessels, and where big fleets were engaged a
special minesweeping officer was placed in supreme
command. Only by close co-ordination of effort
from the staff at Whitehall and elsewhere to
the units at sea could this gigantic work have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
been expeditiously accomplished. It frequently
happened that any delay due to very severe
weather in clearing a field or area meant complete
stoppage or chaotic dislocation of the almost continuous
stream of merchant shipping entering and
leaving a big harbour, which, in turn, disorganised
the adjacent harbours to which ships had often to
be diverted. It disturbed the railway facilities for
the rapid transport of the food or raw materials
from the coast to the manufacturing centres, from
the sugar on the breakfast-table to the shells for
the batteries in France. One hour's delay in unloading
a ship may mean three hours' additional
delay on the railways, the loss of a shift at a munition
works and a day's delay in a great offensive.
It is a curious anomaly, made vividly apparent to
those in administrative command during the past
years of stress, that the more perfect the organisation
the greater the delay in the event of a breakdown
in the system.</p>

<p>There were various methods of minesweeping,
but in all of them the object was to cut the mooring
wire of any mine that came within the area of the
sweep and so cause the mine itself to bob up to the
surface, where it could be seen and destroyed by
gun-fire. In order to encompass this many kinds
of minesweeping gear were devised and given
practical trial during the war. The one most
generally used, however, was the original but
vastly improved sweep. This consisted of a special
wire extended between two ships and held submerged
by a device known as a kite. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
apparatus is best described diagrammatically
(<a href="#Fig_25">Fig. 25</a>).</p>

<p>There was, however, another type of sweep used
for exploratory work and also for sweeping in
shallow water. It was a one-ship sweep (<i>i.e.</i> required
only one vessel to drag it), and this can
also be best described by a diagram (<a href="#Fig_26">Fig. 26</a>).</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<p>It will be observed that in all cases the object is
to drag a submerged wire through the water at an
angle from the ship's course until it encounters the
mooring wire of a mine. When this takes place it is
the purpose of the sweep-wire to cut the mooring
wire and allow the buoyant mine to float up to the
surface free of its sinker (see <a href="#Fig_27">Fig. 27</a>). In order to
effect this various kinds of hard wire with a cutting
capacity were used as sweep-wires, and also numerous
mechanical devices, all of which are more or
less of a secret character; but the object remained
the same&mdash;to find and cut the mooring wire.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>The introduction of what became known as
"delayed action mines"&mdash;weapons held down on
the sea-bed, after being launched, for varying
periods of time, so that sweeping operations might
take place above them without their being discovered;
then, when the time for which the delay
was set had expired, they rose to within ten feet of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the surface and became a great danger to shipping
in places recently swept and reported clear&mdash;caused
a new form of sweep to be devised and used
in waters where these mines were likely to be sown.</p>

<p>This type of sweep was known as a "bottom
sweep," and generally consisted of a chain fitted
into the bight of a sweep-wire and dragged along
the sea-bed, the idea being to overturn the delayed
mine and so upset its mechanism that it would
either rise immediately to the surface or else remain
for ever harmless at the bottom of the sea. In
many cases the heavy chain passing over the horns
of the mine would bend and make them useless, so
destroying the efficiency of the mine even if it did
eventually rise to the correct firing depth.</p>

<p>Into almost every operation carried out on or
under the sea there enters the tide difficulty, and
in all mining and minesweeping operations it is
one of the most important factors to be considered.
The effect of the tide on mine-laying has been dealt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
with in a previous chapter, and the same difficulties
in reverse order are experienced when sweeping the
sea for these invisible and dangerous weapons.
It has already been shown that a vessel may sometimes
pass safely over a mine at high water which
would touch her sides or keel and explode if she
passed over it at low water when the mine was
nearer to the surface. All minesweeping vessels,
therefore, need to be of comparatively shallow
draught in order to reduce the risk of touching
mines, but against this is the fact that shallow-draught
ships, even if powerfully engined, have but
little grip on the water and experience an undue
loss of speed when towing a heavy sweep-wire.
Such vessels can seldom operate in even moderately
heavy weather owing to their rolling and
pitching propensities. Therefore a vessel of
medium&mdash;bordering on shallow&mdash;draught, with a
fairly broad beam, is the best type. Here, again,
is a difficulty. Minesweeping is a type of defensive
warfare requiring a vast number of ships successfully
to carry on against an enemy well provided
with surface and submarine mine-layers, and not
even the greatest naval power in the world could
seriously contemplate maintaining a peace fleet
of, say, 2000 such vessels in constant readiness.
Therefore recourse has to be made, when war
comes, to mercantile craft, which seldom possess
all the desired qualities.</p>

<p>This is what actually occurred in every maritime
country at war during the years succeeding August,
1914, and in order to meet the danger attending<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
the use of passenger ships, trawlers and drifters,
often with a considerable draught, minesweeping
operations were, whenever possible, confined to
the three hours before and the three hours after
high water. Shallow-draught M.L.'s carried out
the scouting for mines at low tide. It is difficult
to see what would be the fate of a nation hemmed
in by mines and devoid of a mercantile fleet sufficiently
numerous to provide powerful sweeping
units. The trawlers and pleasure steamers were
a godsend to England in those years of intensive
submarine warfare. This undeniable fact incidentally
provides another example&mdash;if such is now
needed&mdash;of naval power resting not entirely on
fleets and dockyards, but on every branch and
twig of maritime activity.</p>

<p>It is difficult to describe in small compass and
non-technical language the various tactical formations
employed in minesweeping operations. They
were many and various. The Germans used their
vessels in long lines, the ships being connected
together by a light wire-sweep plentifully supplied
with cutting devices, into which the mooring wire
of the mine was expected to obligingly slip. This
method suffered from the serious drawback that if
any part of the sweep-wire caught on a submerged
obstacle, such as a projection of rock, the whole
line of ships became disorganised. There were also
many other objections to this system, some of
which will doubtless be apparent to the thoughtful
reader.</p>

<p>The formation usually adopted by British minesweepers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
was that shown in Fig. 28, in which it will
be observed that each pair of ships is actually independent
of the others, but is acting in company
with them, and that the pathway swept by one
pair is slightly overlapped by the following pair.
In the event of an accident to one ship the next
astern can immediately let go its own end of sweep-wire
and go to the rescue of any survivors. It
may be apropos to say here that the smaller class
of minesweeper is usually blown to pieces if she
touches a mine.</p>

<p>The set of the tide is another important factor
which has to be taken into serious consideration
when plotting a sweep. This complication enters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
into every operation, and its salient points will be
made quite clear by referring to Fig. 29.</p>

<p>The actual speed at which minesweeping operations
are carried out depends greatly upon the
engine-power of the sweepers themselves. In the
case of trawlers and drifters it is seldom possible to
drag the 300-600 feet of heavy wire through the
water at a greater rate than 4 to 6 knots. M.L.'s
can accomplish 8 knots with a lighter wire, while
big fleet sweepers with engines of several thousand
horse-power can clear the seas at 18-23 knots.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">

<p>Sufficient has now been said to enable the reader
to realise fully the arduous, exciting and often very
hazardous nature of the work. Veteran sweepers
listen for the loud hum of the wire which proclaims<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
that a mine has been caught. Then comes an
interval of a few seconds of suspense. Sometimes
the mine bobs up within a few feet of the ship; at
other times it is in the middle or bight of the wire,
far astern, and half-way between the two sweeping
vessels. When a mine is cut up a few shots from
a 3-pounder, a shattering roar and the mine is
destroyed. All that remains is a column of smoke
reaching from sea to sky.</p>

<p>It frequently happened that the mine became
entangled in the sweeping gear and was unknowingly
hauled on board with the sweep. When this
occurred the position was fraught with extreme
peril. Any roll of the ship might cause an explosion
which would shatter to fragments everything
and everyone within range. Safety lay in
lowering the sweep gently back into the sea&mdash;an
extremely difficult operation on a rough day.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The War Channel</span></div>

<p>This carefully guarded fair-way consisted of a
320-mile stretch of sea, extending along the east
coast of England from the Downs to Newcastle,
which was marked on the seaward side by a continuous
line of gigantic buoys, two miles apart.
It was patrolled day and night by hundreds of
small warships, and swept from end to end by
relays of sweepers acting in conjunction with each
other from the different anti-submarine bases
along the coast.</p>

<p>The war channel formed a comparatively safe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
highway for all coastal shipping passing north or
south through the danger zone, and vessels from
Holland, Denmark, Norway and Sweden were able
to cross the North Sea at any point under escort
and proceed independently and safely along the
British coast to whichever port could most conveniently
accommodate them at the time of their
arrival. It also relieved the terrible congestion
on the railway lines between the north and south
of England by enabling a coast-wise traffic to be
carried on between the ports of London, Grimsby,
Hull and Newcastle, as well as enabling the numerous
Iceland fishing fleet to pass up and down the
coast in comparative safety on their frequent
voyages to and from the fishing grounds of the
far north. From the naval or strategic point of
view it more or less secured a line of supply for the
Grand Fleet assembled in the misty north. Colliers,
oilers, ammunition and food ships were able to proceed
through the comparatively narrow section of
the danger zone with a minimum of risk; and, had
it been required, there was available a cleared
passage for any squadron from the big fighting
formations to come south at high speed to checkmate
a bombardment or attempted landing on
anything like a grand scale.</p>

<p>It may perhaps be wondered why <i>this</i> channel
was not extended up the east coast of Scotland as
far as Scapa Flow. In the first place, the North
Sea widens considerably as the higher latitudes are
approached, the coast of Scotland does not lend
itself to a clearly defined channel and the heavy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
weather which prevails for so many months in the
year made the maintenance of gigantic buoys and
their moorings almost impossible. Secondly, there
were various systems of mine defences in this area,
and, although not defined by a chain of buoys, the
passage north from Newcastle to the Scottish
islands was, in actual fact, maintained by a vast
organisation of patrols and sweepers, but over this
section of sea supply ships for the Grand Fleet
were nearly always under escort. The area from
the Scotch to the German coast was looked upon
more as a possible battle-ground for the fleets at
war than as a route for merchant shipping, owing
to the comparatively few big commercial harbours
along the eastern shore.</p>

<p>Laying the moorings of over 150 gigantic buoys
in fairly deep water, exceptionally prone to sudden
and violent storms, was in itself a noteworthy feat
of submarine engineering. The chains and anchors
had to be of great strength, and the whole work,
which occupied many weeks, was carried out in
waters infested with submarines and mines.</p>

<p>The task of sweeping this vast stretch of sea
almost continuously for four years was by no
means either straightforward or without risk. The
Germans, when they discovered the existence and
purpose of this channel, sought to turn it to their
own advantage by systematically laying mines
around the moorings of the mark-buoys, where
they could only be swept up with great difficulty,
owing to the sweep-wires fouling the moorings of
the buoys. This strategem had to be answered by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the creation of "switch lines," or small sections of
false channel marked by buoys, while the real
channel was only outlined on secret charts. In
this way the preservation of the war channel and
its use for misleading and entrapping U and U-C
boats became a semi-independent campaign, in the
same way as that which surrounded the great mine
barrages and other activities of the anti-submarine
service.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Mine Protection Devices</span></div>

<p>It is an axiom of war that new weapons of attack
are invariably met by new methods of defence.
The mine was no exception to this rule, although
up to the present time the various antidotes are in
all cases only partial remedies. During the years
of war, with the brains of a maritime nation
focused on the subject, there were naturally many
devices suggested and tried for protecting ships
from mines. The great majority of these suggestions
may be classified in two groups: (1) Those
which sought to deflect the mine from the pathway
of the ship; and (2) those which sought to minimise
the result of the explosion. One method
from each of these groups was adopted with various
modifications to suit different classes of ships.</p>

<p>In the first group came the <i>Paravane</i>, which had
as its basis the suspension of a submerged wire
around the bow of a ship, which caught and deflected
the mine-mooring wire before the horns of
the mine itself could reach the sides of the ship.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
It also cut the mooring and enabled the mine to
rise to the surface and be destroyed by gun-fire.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i-206.jpg" width="600" height="378" alt="A Paravane" title="" />
<div class='attrib'><i>Topical Press</i></div>
<span class="caption">A Paravane</span><br />Hoisting in the starboard paravane of the P.V. mine-defence gear.
</div>



<p>In order to understand this appliance it is first
necessary to know what is the action of the majority
of moored mines on coming in contact with a ship.
It seldom happens that a vessel strikes a mine dead
on the bow or stem-post. The cushion and dislocation
of water formed by a big and fast ship
around its bows is usually sufficient to cause the
mine to swing a few inches away from the bow and
to return and strike the ship several feet back on
the port or starboard side. A careful study of
Fig. 30 will show how this is prevented by the
deflecting wires of the paravane.</p>

<p>The paravanes themselves are submerged
torpedo-shaped bodies which hold the wires under
the surface and away from the ship's side, deriving
their ability to do this from the speed at which
they are being towed, submerged, by the ship
itself. A piece of string through the axle hole of a
small wheel, which is then placed on the ground
and pulled along, will give a good idea of the action
of the paravane against the passing water.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>

ship. In such a case it would slide down the deflecting wire
towards the paravane, where the mooring would be cut and the
mine would float to the surface.</b></div>

<p>It is not possible to give here the exact details of
this highly ingenious device upon which so much
scientific and practical attention was wisely bestowed,
but sufficient has been said to enable the
reader to form a clear conception of how the mine
was caught and held away from the ship's side by
the deflecting wire of the paravane.</p>

<p>This device, in one of its many forms, was fitted
not only to warships, but also to many hundreds of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
merchantmen, and was known to have saved
thousands of tons of valuable shipping and cargo.</p>

<p>Among those devices which had for their object
the minimising of the result of a mine explosion
may be mentioned the "Blister System" so
successfully employed in the construction of
monitors and other big ships, the idea being to
surround the inner hull with an outer casing which
received the effect of the explosion of either a mine
or torpedo and left the inner or real hull of the
ship water-tight. Its one weak feature was that
it reduced the speed of the ship and the ease with
which she could be man[oe]uvred. In future types
of large and heavily armed ships this drawback
will undoubtedly be largely overcome by an
increase in engine-power made possible by the
development of engineering science.</p>

<p>The "blister," although outwardly forming a
continuous structure round the entire vessel,
extending well above and below the water-line,
tapered off towards the bows and stern, and was
subdivided into different compartments. In this
way an explosion against one section did not
necessarily damage any other part. The British
monitors which so successfully bombarded the
Belgian coast and the fortifications of the Dardanelles
were fitted with blisters, and more than
one of them owed their salvation to this means.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>THE MINE BARRAGE</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">What</span> undoubtedly forms the most effective
counter to unrestricted submarine warfare is the
explosive mine barrage, as employed against the
German U-boats in the North Sea and the Straits
of Dover.</div>

<p>The practicability of these barrage systems
depends, however, very largely upon the following
factors:&mdash;(1) the geographical features of the area
of operations; (2) the hydrographical peculiarities
of the seas in which the mines have to be laid;
(3) the number of properly equipped mine-laying
vessels available; (4) an adequate and highly
trained personnel; and (5) the mechanical skill
and manufacturing power of the nation employing
the system.</p>

<p>There are several forms of mine barrage. One
is simply an elongated mine-field laid across a
narrow sea to prevent the safe passage of hostile
surface craft. In this case the mines are laid in
the ordinary manner and at the ordinary depth
below the surface. The anti-submarine barrage,
however, consists of an enormous number of mines,
laid <i>at a considerable depth below the surface</i> and in
such formation as to ensure that a submarine
attempting to pass through the cordon <i>while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
submerged</i> would inevitably collide with one or
more of them.</p>

<p>With this latter form of barrage the surface of
the sea is quite clear of mines and is comparatively
safe for the unrestricted movement of a numerous
patrol flotilla, which forms part of the system, the
under-seas alone being made dangerous by the mines.</p>

<p>It will be apparent that if a hostile submarine
base is enclosed by one or more of these barrages
the under-water craft entering and leaving that
base have the choice of travelling <i>submerged</i> across
the danger zone and thereby risking contact with
the mines, or of performing the passage <i>on the
surface</i> and encountering the patrolling ships. In
either case, the result is more likely than not to be
the destruction of the submarine.</p>

<p>In most cases the exact position of the barrage
would be unknown to the hostile submarines,
which, even if running on the surface, would dive
immediately on the approach of a patrol ship.
The few lucky ones succeeding in getting safely
through the cordon of deep-laid mines, or passing
unnoticed the patrol of surface ships on their outward
journey&mdash;as might be the case in fog&mdash;would
have the same peril to face on the return to their
base, and probably without the aid of thick weather.
This double risk would probably have to be taken
by every submarine in the active flotilla at least
once a month, this being approximately the period
they can remain at sea without replenishing
supplies of fuel, torpedoes and food.</p>

<p>The object of the flotillas of shallow-draught<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
patrol vessels operating in the vicinity of the deep
mine barrier is twofold. Primarily their duty is to
prevent the hostile submarines from running the
blockade on the surface and, secondly, to prevent
enemy surface craft from emerging from the base
and sweeping clear a passage through the mine-field,
or of laying counter-mines, which, on being
exploded, would detonate some of the blockading
deep-laid mines and so destroy a section of the
barrier.</p>

<p>From this it will be apparent that a force of
hostile submarines hemmed in in this way would
run a double risk of losing a number of vessels on
every occasion on which a sortie was made. This
is what actually occurred to the German under-water
flotillas in the years 1917-1919, and, in combination
with the other methods employed by the
Allied navies, was mainly responsible for the failure
of the great under-sea offensive.</p>

<p>The only bases of the German navy being situated
on the North Sea littoral, it was possible for
the Allies to lay a vast mine barrier, stretching
from the coast of Norway to the Scottish islands,
and another smaller one across the Straits of Dover;
also to concentrate in the vicinity of these two submarine
"trench systems" a very numerous surface
patrolling force, thus enclosing the thousands of
square miles of sea forming what was sometimes
boastfully referred to as the "German Ocean" in
an almost impenetrable ring of steel and T.N.T.</p>

<p>Here let us consider the gigantic nature of the
task that was successfully accomplished. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
distance from the Norwegian coast to the Orkney
Islands is approximately 600 miles. It was over
this vast expanse of sea, bent at the eastern end so
as to rest on the Heligoland Bight, that the system
known as the "Northern Barrages" extended. No
exact statistics of the actual number of mines used
is at present available, but reckoning at the low
rate of one mine to every 750 feet of sea, with five
lines stretching from shore to shore, the number
required would be 21,000 of these costly and difficult
weapons. The number required annually to
maintain such a barrage would also be very heavy,
and it is safe to assume that <i>considerably</i> over 50,000
mines were employed on the northern barrages
alone. From this rough estimate some idea of the
work of designing, manufacturing, testing, laying,
renewing and watching this one field will be
obtained.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i-213.jpg" width="450" height="192" alt="Fig. 31.&mdash;Diagram illustrating a mine barrage, or deep-laid mine-field." title="" />
</div>
<div class='hang1'><b><span class="smcap">Fig. 31.</span>&mdash;Diagram illustrating a mine barrage, or deep-laid mine-field.
The submarine <i>A</i>, diving to avoid a surface warship, has
become entangled in the mooring of a deep-laid mine which is
being dragged down on top of her. These mines are often
moored at a depth of 60 feet below the surface, which can then
be patrolled by surface warships.</b></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>There were, of course, in the actual barrage
several mine-fields placed strategically, and probably
a far greater number of weapons than that
given in the above estimate was needed. There
were also the smaller fields lying between the
northern barrage and the one across the Straits of
Dover. These were so placed as to catch hostile
submarines operating off the east coast of England,
or a surface raiding squadron, such as those which
in the earlier years of the war bombarded certain
British ports.</p>

<p>Finally, when victory had been achieved, there
came the cold-blooded task of clearing these immense
areas of sea, not only of German mines, laid
haphazardly, but also of the thousands of British
mines laid methodically and away from neutral
traffic.</p>

<p>The English Channel barrage differed from the
northern line in several important respects. Being
so much shorter (31 miles against 680), it could
more easily be made perfect. The swift-running
tide, however, greatly increased the difficulty of
laying effective mine-fields.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Lighted Barrage</span></div>

<p>This southern system consisted, on the surface,
of a number of vessels specially built to ride out
the heaviest gale at anchor. These were moored
at intervals across the Straits of Dover, forming
two lines from the English to the French coast.
The first line extended from Folkestone to Cape<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Gris Nez, and the second line about seven miles to
the westward of these points (see <a href="#Fig_32">Fig. 32</a>). Each
vessel was fitted with powerful searchlights for use
at night, and the dark spaces of sea between were
patrolled by large numbers of armed craft.</p>

run the blockade in a submerged condition.</b></div>

<p>By this means the only avenues by which hostile
submarines could hope to pass on the surface
through the barrage at night were the dark lanes
of water between the lightships. It was these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
points which were closely guarded by strong patrol
flotillas, whose duty it was to attack submarines
attempting to get through and, with the aid of
guns and depth charges, to force them to dive
below the surface.</p>

<p>Here certain destruction awaited them on the
submerged mine-fields. If, however, one line of
defence was safely passed by a hostile submarine,
there was another to be negotiated seven miles
farther on, and once a submarine got <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'bteween'">between</ins> the
two lines her chances of escape were indeed small,
for whichever way she turned the surface would be
covered with fast patrol craft and at night lighted
by the rays of many searchlights, while the under-seas
were almost impassable with mines.</p>

<p>If, however, notwithstanding these defensive
systems, a submarine succeeded in passing through
and getting to work on the lines of communication
with the armies in France, there were hydrophone
organisations and patrols all down the Channel
from the lighted barrage to the Scilly Islands. By
this means a U-boat would be seldom out of the
hearing of these instruments for more than an hour
or so at a time.</p>

<p>The success which attended the perfecting of this
vast system was such that German submarines
based on the Flanders coast gave up attempting
to pass down the English Channel. They tried to
go to and from their hunting grounds on the
Atlantic trade routes round the north coast of
Scotland. Here the great northern systems took
their toll.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>During the first nine months of the year 1918
the German submarine flotillas at Zeebrugge and
Ostend lost thirty vessels, and no less than fifteen
of these had, at the time of the signing of the
Armistice, been discovered lying wrecked under
the lighted barrage.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>OFF TO THE ZONES OF WAR</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Hitherto</span> I have dealt with the scientific training
of the personnel, the armament and the general
organisation of the anti-submarine fleets, leaving
it to the imagination of readers to invest the bare
recital of facts with the due amount of romance.
If, however, a true understanding of this most
modern form of naval war is to be obtained, the
human aspect must loom large in future pages.</div>

<p>War, whether it be <i>on</i> the sea, <i>under</i> the sea, on
the land or in the air, is a science in which the
human element is of at least equal importance
with that of the purely mechanical. It is a science
of both "blood and iron."</p>

<p>The armed motor launches described in earlier
pages, after being built in Canada to the number
of over 500, and engined by the United States,
were transported across the Atlantic on the
decks of big ocean-going steamships&mdash;more than
one of which was torpedoed on the voyage. On
their arrival in Portsmouth dockyard the guns and
depth charges were placed aboard and the vessels
thoroughly equipped and fitted out for active
service.</p>

<p>Officers and men were drafted from the training
establishments of the new navy at Southampton,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Portsmouth, Chatham, Greenwich and elsewhere.
Each little vessel was given a number, and within
a few weeks of their arrival from the building yards
on the St Lawrence they sailed in flotillas out past
the fortifications of Spithead, <i>en route</i> for their
respective war bases.</p>

<p>Great secrecy had surrounded the construction
of these small but powerful craft, and but few naval
men, except those directly engaged in the anti-submarine
service, had either seen or heard much of
them until they commenced arriving at the
different rendezvous.</p>

<p>Among the early flotillas to leave Portsmouth
dockyard was one of four ships destined for a base
on the east coast of Scotland, and as these speedy
little craft raced away north the expectations of
both officers and men ran high.</p>

<p>It was in the early summer of 1916, and although
the air was crisp, the sea sparkled in the bright
sunlight and the sky was a cloudless blue. Only a
heavy-beam sea off Flamborough Head had marred
the maiden voyage, and they were now on the last
hundred miles, with the low-lying Farne Islands
fading into the mist astern. By nightfall, if the
wind remained light, they would make the Scottish
port which was to form their base of operations.</p>

<p>Hitherto these four brand-new little warships,
all white wood, grey paint and polished metal, had
been plodding over the 600 miles of sea from Portsmouth
at what was termed "cruising speed"&mdash;a
mere 10 knots. The engines had not been opened
out to "full ahead" because these delicate pieces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
of mechanism needed time to settle down to their
work before it was safe to drive them to the utmost
limit of speed and power, but now that pistons and
bearings had been given time to "run in" it was
considered safe for the flotilla to increase speed in
order to make harbour by nightfall.</p>

<p>A hoist of new, bright-coloured flags fluttered
from the squat mast of the leading ship. The
steady throbbing of the engines grew suddenly to a
low staccato roar. The white waves astern rose up
almost level with the counters and clouds of fine
spray blew across the decks. This rapid movement
through the sun-lit water, with the breeze of
passage and the tang of the salt sea in every
breath, was exhilarating, and the spirits of those
aboard rose with the speed.</p>

<p>Running at nearly half-a-mile a minute, the
flotilla forged northwards through clouds of fine,
stinging spray, until at a late hour, when the sun
was dipping below the horizon and the sea was a
sheet of golden light, a smoky line appeared far
away to the westward. It was that section of the
Scottish coast which in future it would be the duty
of these boats to patrol, and as the distance
lessened those on board gazed in silence at the
gigantic cliffs and black rocks, now tinged with the
rays of the dying sun and encircled by the endless
ripples which alone broke the peaceful surface of
the sea, but one and all were picturing this forbidding
coast on the stormy winter nights to come.</p>

<p>Slowly the light faded from the western sky.
The cliffs rose up black and sombre, and when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
little flotilla turned westwards up the broad waterway
leading to the base darkness had closed over
land and sea. For some time they picked their
way up this sheltered loch. No lights were visible,
but more than once a destroyer appeared out of the
blackness to make sure of their identity, and each
time they were inspected very closely before the
guard-ships were satisfied. An armed trawler
guided them past dangerous obstructions and then
faded into the night. Mile after mile of water was
then traversed on courses laid down in confidential
orders.</p>

<p>Suddenly a searchlight flashed out from close
ahead, followed almost instantly by other blinding
rays, which swept the sea for a few seconds, and
then all the beams concentrated on the little
flotilla, showing up with the clearness of daylight
the four low-lying submarine-like hulls gliding
speedily through the water. There was a moment's
silence, during which the Morse signalling lamps of
the M.L.'s were being prepared to flash out their
message. A searchlight blinked and there followed
another brief interval of silence, then, without
warning, a tongue of livid flame stabbed the darkness
and a shell whistled overhead. It was
followed by other flashes and the sharp reports of
quick-firing guns. Columns of water spouted into
the air close to the M.L.'s, whose engines had,
luckily, ceased to throb. The firing stopped as
suddenly as it had commenced. Signals began
flashing angrily in many directions. Destroyers
tore out of the darkness around into the broad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
circle of light. Armed trawlers nosed their way
in and wicked grey tubes were trained on the now
stationary flotilla. Presently the angry flashing
of mast head-lights subsided into the regular dot
and dash of respectable communication. Several
destroyers seemed to be having nasty things said
to them, which they answered with a feeble wink,
and an armed trawler made futile flashes of
explanation.</p>

<p>A little twinkling star, more lofty and dignified
than the rest, called up the leading M.L. and was
answered with an alacrity that evidently unnerved
it, for it flickered and died out. Suddenly it came
to life again and winked away at an alarming rate,
but all to no purpose, for, true to the old axiom
that more haste means less speed, it had to stop
and go over the message again, this time sufficiently
slow for novices to understand. What it said is
a State secret. It is rumoured, however, that
several officers were "mentioned in dispatches"
for the part they played in this local action, caused
by mistaken identity, but alas! their skill and
bravery remained unrewarded by an unsympathetic
Government.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>A MEMORABLE CHRISTMAS</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">No</span> calling tempers the human steel in so short a
period as that of the sea. At all times and in
every part of the world the sailorman wages a
never-ending fight with Nature in her wildest and
most dreaded modes. When to this is added a
conflict of nations and their ships, with all the
ingenious death-traps of modern naval science, it
merely increases the odds against him and serves
to steady his hand and brain in order to overcome
them.</div>

<p>In a few short weeks the sea had set its stamp
on the men of the new navy. Faces became
bronzed by the sun, wind and spindrift. Muscles
grew hard and eyes and nerves more steady.
Each time a vessel went forth on patrol or other
duty new difficulties or dangers were met and
overcome without advice or assistance, and the
confidence of men in themselves and in the ships
they worked grew apace.</p>

<p>In many of the principal zones of war, such as the
North Sea and the Atlantic, the wind grew colder
and the seas more fierce as the short summer
passed. Duffel or Arctic clothing was served out
to both officers and men. Sea-boots and oilskins
became necessary. Balaclava helmets, mufflers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
and other woollen gear appeared, and men became
almost unrecognisable bundles of clothing. The
ascent at 4 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> from the cabin to the cold, wet
deck can be likened only to the first plunge of a
cold bathing season. Casualties became more
frequent as the enemy intensified his submarine
and mining campaign. The news and sight of
sudden death no longer blanched the faces of men
who knew that it might be their turn at any
moment of every day and night. The stir of
suppressed excitement when danger threatened
no longer manifested itself in every movement, but
rather in the cool, deliberate action of self-confidence.
In a word, the raw material was being
tempered in the furnace of war.</p>

<p>To those in northern seas came the blinding
sleet, the slate-grey combers and the innumerable
hardships and dangers of winter patrol. A better
idea of what these really were will be obtained
from the following account of a Christmas spent
on a German mine-field.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>A bitter wind swept the grey wastes of the
North Sea and a fine haze of snow, driven by stinging
gusts, obscured all except the long hillocks
of water which rose and fell around the tiny M.L.&mdash;a
lonely thirty tons of nautical humanity in as
many square leagues of sub-Arctic sea.</p>

<p>Nineteen degrees of frost during the long winter
night had flattened the boisterous, foam-capped
waves, and now, in the early December dawn, all
within vision was of that colourless grey so familiar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
to those who kept the North Sea on the winter
patrol.</p>

<p>It was one bell in the first watch and three
shapeless figures clad in duffel coats with big hoods
and wearing heavy sea-boots stood silent in the
draughty, canvas-screened wheel-house as M.L.822
wallowed northwards through the seas which came
in endless succession out of the snowy mist. It
was just the ordinary everyday patrol duty, when
nothing was expected but anything might happen,
so eyes were strained seawards in a vain endeavour
to penetrate the icy curtain blowing down from the
Pole. Twelve hours more of half-frozen existence
stretched in front of these silent watchers, as they
clung with stiffened limbs to ropes stretched
purposely handy to keep them upright when the
little ship lurched more fiercely in a steeper sea.</p>

<p>Of the three figures in the meagre shelter of the
wheel-house there was little to distinguish who or
what they were, except, perhaps, a cleaner and
more yellowish duffel coat and a big white muffler
in which the lieutenant-in-command tried, without
success, to keep his teeth from chattering and the
icy draught from finding its way into the seemingly
endless openings of his woollen clothing. What he
had been before the Great War and the North Sea
claimed him was a mystery to those on board, but
the people of more than one capital knew his name.
Near by stood a younger man&mdash;a boy before the
war&mdash;who, although pale and dark-eyed, did not
appear to feel the intense cold so much, although
the dampness of the long-past summer fogs had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
chilled him to the bone. He was the sub-lieutenant,
and hailed from the Great North-West, where
Canadian winters had hardened his skin to the
stinging dry cold.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 188px;">
<img src="images/i-228.jpg" width="188" height="400" alt="Fig. 33.&mdash;Duffel or Arctic clothing." title="" />
</div>

<div class='center'><b><span class="smcap">Fig. 33.</span>&mdash;Duffel or Arctic clothing.</b></div>

<p>The immense bundle of nondescript clothing
at the wheel was "Mac," the coxswain, whose
voyages in Arctic seas with the Iceland fishing fleet
numbered more than his years of life, and whose
deep-voiced Gaelic roar could bring the "watch
below" on to the cold, wet deck to their action
stations in less time than it would take a new
recruit to tumble out of his hammock.</p>

<p>Although the silence of the sea seems to settle on
its watchers in those northern marches, there was
an unduly long absence of comment on the nature
of the weather and the prospects of "something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
exciting" turning up out of the icy mist. The
reason lay in the subconscious mind of all on deck,
for it was Christmas morning, 1916, and the
thoughts of all were dwelling on past years in the
cheery surroundings of English and Colonial homes&mdash;in
vivid contrast to the dismal grey of the North
Sea. To break the spell of memory both officers
felt would be blasphemy, and yet a feeble attempt
at conversation was made every now and then for
the sake of appearances.</p>

<p>To Mac, from the Orkneys, no such sentiment
held sway, for Christmas to him meant little compared
with New Year's Day; but this was a special
Christmas, for a big plum pudding was being boiled
on the petrol stove below, and each roll of the little
vessel threatened its useful existence. Eventually
he could keep silent no longer and tentatively suggested
a change of course to ease the violent lurching.
The wheel was spun round with alacrity as
the telegraph rang out below and the engines
slowed down to a slow pulsating throb. The
sharp bows of the patrol boat rose dripping from
each green-grey mass of sea as it rolled up out of the
white haze ahead and then fell gently back into the
trough. The violent pitching gave place to a more
easy see-saw movement, and in spite of the cold,
which seemed to grow keener every minute to the
half-numbed figures on deck, a grunt of satisfaction
escaped the helmsman, and visions of steaming
plum duff&mdash;a present from the Admiral's wife&mdash;supplanted
the more anxious thoughts of war and
the dangers of mine and submarine which lay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
hidden in the white snow-mists and grey seas
around.</p>

<p>The four hands in the forecastle, who formed
the watch below, were lying on their bunks, for
sitting meant holding on, and were discussing
orgies on past Christmas days and planning future
ones with a nonchalance bred of daily rubbing
shoulders with danger and death. Snatches of
popular music hall songs penetrated the closed
hatchways, but were drowned by the splash of the
sea against the ship's side.</p>

<p>This silent battle with monotony, bitter cold
and drenching showers of spray, with several
numbing hours on deck, followed by an equal
time lying on the bunks below&mdash;still cold and
wet, for fires and dry clothes were almost unknown
in the patrol boats during the long winter
months in the cruel northern seas&mdash;might have
lasted all day, until darkness and increasing
cold added their quota to the sum of misery,
and the day patrol crept silently into harbour,
to be relieved by their brethren of the night
guard.</p>

<p>But such was not to be, for it was a Christmas
Day that will live for ever in the memory of the
men on Patrol Launch No. 822, to be recalled in
the peaceful years ahead to eager listeners at
many a fireside.</p>

<p>Two bells in the afternoon watch had barely
struck when from out of the haze ahead came a
low reverberating boom! The three figures on
the bridge stiffened to alertness and the chilled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
blood went coursing more warmly through their
veins. A few seconds of strained listening, rewarded
only by the noise of the sea, then the telegraph
was moved forward, a sharp jangle of bells
came from the engine-room and forecastle and the
slow pulsating of the motors grew to a loud roar.
The watch below came tumbling on to the wet
deck, to be lashed with clouds of blinding, stinging
spray, which now flew high over the little ship as
the 400-horse-power engines drove her at 18 knots
through the grey, misty seas.</p>

<p>Experience had made that dull roar familiar to
all on board, and it needed no order from the now
hard-faced C.O. to cause every man to don his
"capuc" life-belt in readiness for the hidden
dangers which they knew to be strewn in the
pathways of the sea ahead.</p>

<p>Mines are moored at a given depth below the
surface, usually from six to ten feet. The rise and
fall of the tide, therefore, either increases or decreases
the stratum of free water above them.
This causes these invisible submarine weapons to
be more dangerous to shallow-draught vessels, such
as motor patrol launches, at low tide, when there is
little water between the tops of their horns and the
surface, than at high tide. More will, however, be
said in a later chapter about mines and the difficulties
of laying them.</p>

<p>It so happened that on this occasion the tide was
low and the mines consequently extremely dangerous
to even the shallowest draught type of warship.
The speed of the M.L. was increased until<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the twin engines were revolving at the rate of 490
a minute.</p>

<p>The snow haze seemed suddenly to grow thicker
and all around the flurries of white blotted out the
distant view. The minutes of pounding through
the slate-grey seas seemed interminably long, and
the flying clouds of icy spray stung every exposed
part of the human frame.</p>

<p>When about three sea miles had been traversed
the engines were stopped and all on board listened
for a cry from the sea ahead. The C.O. pulled the
peak of his drenched cap farther over his eyes and
gazed out into the opaque greyness ahead.</p>

<p>Minutes passed; but little ships cannot rest
quietly on the open sea. The lash of the water
and the slapping of the meagre rigging drowned any
faint sound there might have been, and once more
the engines throbbed to the order "Slow ahead!"</p>

<p>Barely had the ship gathered way before a dark
object appeared momentarily in the trough of the
sea about two degrees on the starboard bow and
the next instant seemed swallowed up.</p>

<p>A warning cry from the look-out on the tiny
sea-washed fo'c'sle head, a sharp order from the
bridge, and, within its own length, the patrol boat
swung rapidly to port. At the same moment a
dan-buoy splashed overboard to mark the position
of the floating mine. A few yards more to the
eastward and No. 822 would have appeared in
the list of the missing.</p>

<p>Minutes of tense nerve strain followed, for all
knew that the ship was in the midst of a mine-field,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
and the deadly horns which had been momentarily
visible on the surface were but a single example
of the many which lurked around. Eyes were
strained into the grey-green depths, and yet all
knew the impossibility of seeing. Again the look-out's
warning cry and the engines were reversed,
but this time it was not a mine, but the victim of
one, holding on to a piece of wreckage.</p>

<p>Willing hands hauled the half-frozen form on
board and stanched the blood that still oozed
from cuts on the face and neck. Blankets and
hot-water bottles were soon forthcoming, and the
battered remnant&mdash;for both a leg and thigh bone
were broken&mdash;was placed as carefully as the lurching
of the ship would allow in the aft-cabin bunk.
Before this could be accomplished, however, a cry
again rang out from the watch on the fo'c'sle head
and yet another body was hauled aboard, but the
shock or the cold had here taken its toll.</p>

<p>The sea around was searched in vain for further
survivors. A few planks, a signal locker, a broken
life-raft and a meat-safe were all that was left of
the trawler <i>Mayflower</i>, homeward bound from
Iceland to Grimsby.</p>

<p>A silence seemed to brood over the patrol boat
as she slowly picked her way out of the mine-field.
The crew went about their tasks without the usual
jests and snatches of song, and the pudding, which
but a few short hours before had seemed the most
important event of the day, lay unheeded on the
floor of the galley, where it had been thrown by
the cook in the haste for hot water.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>In the failing light of the December afternoon
the bow of the patrol boat was turned shorewards,
and, with a rising sea curling up astern, she raced
through the slate-grey water with her burden of
living and dead. It was one of those moments
which call for a rapid decision on a difficult point,
when the order had to be given for the course to be
laid for harbour, and the C.O., cold and miserably
wet after seven hours on the bridge, wore an
anxious look. He knew not which had the greater
claim, the desperately wounded man in the cabin
or other ships which might bear down on the mine-field
during the long bitter night. It was a point
on which the rules of war and the dictates of
humanity clashed.</p>

<p>Again the ship was turned into the rapidly
darkening east, and all through that bitter night
the field of death was guarded. Stiffened fingers
flashed out the warning signal when black hulls
loomed out of the darkness. Numbed limbs clung
for dear life when green seas washed the tiny decks,
and when dawn broke over the waste of tumbling
sea the men on M.L.822 knew that Christmas
Day, 1916, would live for ever in their memory.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>THE DERELICT</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">There</span> are few things more heart-breaking than
sea patrol, which forms the principal duty of anti-submarine
fleets. Hours, days and even months
may pass with nothing to relieve the monotony of
grey sea and sky, with occasional glimpses of wave-tossed
ships.</div>

<p>There are, of course, intervening periods in
harbour, when fierce gales howl overhead, and
guard duty on rain-swept quaysides, or sentry-go
in blinding snowstorms, comes almost as a relief
from the sameness of winter days on northern seas.</p>

<p>It is, however, the unexpected which generally
occurs in war, and during those terrible winters
from 1914-1918 it was the ever-present hope of
action that kept the spirits of many a sailorman
from sinking below the Plimsoll line of health.</p>

<p>Sometimes the happenings were grave and at
other times gay, but always they were welcomed
eagerly, as providing excitement or change, with
something to talk about in the unknown number
of dreary weeks ahead.</p>

<p>An episode of this kind occurred one snowy
January night in 1917 on the quayside of a northern
seaport. The commanding officer of one of the
patrol boats in the harbour was going ashore to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
stay for the night with some friends. Knowing
that his ship was due to proceed to sea early the
following morning, he took the precaution to place
a small alarm clock in the big pocket of his bridge-coat.
Groping his way in the darkness and blinding
snow across the gangway leading from the ship
to the quay, he succeeded in reaching the dock wall.
Almost instantly he was challenged by a military
sentry on duty and was about to reply when a loud
buzzing noise came from his pocket. He had not
thought of ascertaining at what time the alarm
clock had been set for and the consequences were
distinctly unpleasant.</p>

<p>The sentry, hearing the curious buzzing sound
coming from the darkness directly he had given
the challenge, and thinking it came from some
form of bomb, lunged smartly with his bayonet at
the spot from which the sound emanated.</p>

<p>Fortunately the officer was near the edge of the
dock wall and did not receive the full effect of the
thrust. The bayonet tore his coat and pushed
him violently over the edge into the icy water of
the harbour. His lusty shouts caused searchlights
to be turned on and he was rescued promptly, but
the episode, small and unimportant as it was,
caused considerable merriment&mdash;except to the
principal actor&mdash;for many days afterwards.</p>

<p>All this may sound much like heresy to those
who think that naval war means constant fighting,
with all the pomp and circumstance of old-time
battles. There are, it is true, never-to-be-forgotten
moments when the blood surges and pulses beat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
rapidly, when the months of weary waiting are
atoned for in as many minutes of swift action.
Such were Jutland, Zeebrugge, Heligoland, the
Falklands and many an unrecorded fight on
England's sea frontier in the years just past. Such
times pass rapidly, however; they are the milestones
of war, leaving the weary leagues between,
in which there is so much that is sordid and even
ghastly, as will be seen from the following.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The sea offers but few sights more melancholy
than the wave-washed derelict&mdash;the now desolate,
helpless and forlorn thing that was once a <i>ship</i>, the
home of men&mdash;seen in the half-light of a winter
dawn, rising and falling sluggishly on the dirty grey
swell&mdash;the aftermath of storm&mdash;with white water
washing through its broken bulwarks, yards and
sails adrift, a thing without life on the sad sea waves.</p>

<p>A wireless message from a ship passing the
derelict on the previous day had brought an M.L.
from the nearest naval base to search the area,
and after a night of wandering over shadowy grey
slopes of water the dawn had revealed it less than
two miles distant.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt as to its nationality, for
the white cross of Denmark, on the red ground, was
painted on the weather-beaten sides, now showing
just above the sea. Deserted and half-waterlogged,
it was being kept afloat by a cargo of timber,
some of which could be seen in chaos on the deck.</p>

<p>The M.L. approached cautiously, with thick rope
fenders over her rubbing-streak to prevent the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
frail hull from being damaged. This coming
alongside other ships in the open sea, except in the
very calmest of weather, is a ticklish man[oe]uvre,
and requires considerable skill in the handling of
these small and very fragile craft. What would
be considered quite a light blow on the stout hull
of any ordinary ship would crush in the thin
timbers of a patrol launch, for in the construction
of these boats speed and shallow draught were the
predominant factors considered.</p>

<p>When the M.L. had been made fast on the lee-side
of the derelict a boarding party scrambled
over the damaged bulwarks on to the sea-washed
deck. Here was a scene of chaos&mdash;rigging
tangled and swinging loosely from masts and
yards; sails torn and shreds still clinging to
ropes and spars; loose planks of her deck cargo
lying all over the place, and a general air of
abandon and desolation difficult to describe.</p>

<p>A mass of broken woodwork in the well of the
ship was soon discovered to be the remains of a
deck-house, and this gave the first clue to the
reason for her sorry plight. Pieces of shrapnel
were found sticking in the timbers, and further
search revealed shell-holes through the hull and
cut rigging. A signal was flying from the mizen
halyards, and the name on the counter, although
spattered with shot, was still, in part, decipherable&mdash;<i>Rickivik</i>,
Copenhafen.</p>

<p>So the officer in charge of the boarding party
commenced his report with the name of the ship
and the port from which she hailed, adding thereto<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
the evident fact that she had been heavily shelled&mdash;just
a brief statement which left to the imagination
all the incidents and, alas! tragedies of an
unequal fight.</p>

<p>A high-explosive shell had struck the little raised
poop, demolishing the hatchway leading to the
cabins beneath, and some heavy work with axe
and saw would have been necessary to obtain an
entry had an easier way not been available through
the shattered skylight. In the low-roofed cabin
all was disorder. Tables and lockers were
smashed, and the shell which had burst overhead
had filled the place with heavy broken timbers
from the deck above.</p>

<p>So low was the cabin roof of this small three-masted
barque, and so dark the interior, that it
was difficult to see about. A lantern was procured
and a careful search commenced. The yellow
light fell on drawers pulled out and their contents&mdash;when
worthless&mdash;flung on the floor; glasses
and bottles smashed and a quaint old China figure
lying intact on the broken timbers. But of the
ship's papers there was no trace, with the single
exception of an old Bill of Health, issued six years
previously in Baltimore. Then the area of search
moved from the cupboards and drawers to the
floor&mdash;broken by a shell which had evidently penetrated
the ship's stern and passed longitudinally
through the cabin, exploding near the base of the
companion-hatch.</p>

<p>Presently a startled exclamation, followed by a
call for the light, came from the gloom around the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
stairway. Two of the boarding party searching
among the debris had stumbled across something
which, instinctively, sent a cold shiver through
them. The light, when moved in that direction,
dimly revealed the body of a man lying face downwards
on the floor. Only the lower half of the
figure was, however, visible, a mass of shattered
timbers having collapsed on the head and shoulders.
That life had been extinct for some considerable
time was evidenced by the sickly odour which hung
heavily in the less ventilated parts of the cabin,
and the work of extricating the body was not commenced
before the whole ship had been searched
for possible survivors.</p>

<p>This work occupied a considerable time, but
nothing of importance was discovered until a slight
noise, not unlike the feeble, inarticulate cry of a
child in pain, came through the timbers from
some distant part of the hold. It was repeated
several times, and the sailors, without waiting
for orders, set hastily to work to find out the
cause.</p>

<p>The hatches were carefully removed, but only
floating timber could be seen. Then the sound
came again. This time it was unmistakable and
relieved the tension. A little grim laugh from the
searchers was followed by much poking about with
a long piece of wood on the surface of the flooded
hold under the decking, and some minutes later a
large pile of timber floated into the light from the
open hatchway, supporting a big tortoiseshell cat,
looking very wet and emaciated. "Ricky"&mdash;for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
such is her name now&mdash;proved to be the only living
thing on that ill-fated ship.</p>

<p>The boarding party returned to the cabin and
commenced the objectionable task of extricating
the dead body from the mass of wreckage. The
work proceeded slowly, for the heavy broken
timbers pressed mercilessly on the object beneath,
and when at last it lay revealed in the dim lantern
light its ghastly appearance caused all to step back
in horror. It was a headless corpse!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>MINED-IN</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">How</span> many people realise that, with a single unimportant
exception, there was no part of the
English or Scottish coast which was not mined-in
at least once by German submarines during 1914-1918?
Harbour entrances, often less than two
miles from the shore, were repeatedly blocked by
lines of hostile mines, laid by U-C boats through
their stern tubes, in which they seldom carried less
than fifteen to twenty of these deadly weapons,
without the vessels rising to the surface either
when approaching the coast, laying the mines or
effecting their escape.</div>

<p>Many important waterways, such as the Straits
of Dover, the mouth of the Thames, the approaches
to Liverpool, the Firth of Forth, Aberdeen, Lowestoft
and Portsmouth, were repeatedly chosen for
this form of submarine attack. At one base alone
no less than 400 mines were destroyed by the
attached anti-submarine flotillas in one year, and
round the coasts of the United Kingdom an average
of about 3000 of these invisible weapons were
located and destroyed annually.</p>

<p>What this meant to the 24,000,000 tons of
mercantile shipping passing to and fro through the
danger zone <i>every month</i> will be better realised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
when it is stated that less than 400 merchant ships
were blown up by mines during the three years of
intensive submarine warfare.</p>

<p>The losses among the minesweeping and patrol
flotillas, which were mainly responsible for the
crushing defeat of this piratical campaign, were,
however, very heavy. They amounted to over
200 ships and several thousand men. Few
will therefore deny to those who lived and to
those who died a share in the glory of the great
victory.</p>

<p>Statistics make but uninteresting reading, and
from the following account of what happened off
a big Scottish seaport while the inhabitants
ashore slept in peace and safety a better idea
will be obtained of the arduous nature of the
work of minesweeping and patrol in time of
war than could possibly be imparted by pages
of figures.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The early dusk of a winter evening was settling
over a white land and a leaden sea. A mist of
sliding snow increased the gloom and blotted out
the vessels ahead and astern as the line of patrol
boats left the comparative warmth and security of
one of the largest northern harbours for twelve
hours in the bitter frost on night patrol.</p>

<p>The cold was intense and of that penetrating
nature which causes men to shiver even in the
thickest of clothing. Although some eighteen
degrees of frost had flattened the sea, a freezing
spray still blew in showers over the narrow deck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
and, for just a few minutes, the lead-grey sky
gleamed dully red as the sun dipped below the
snow-covered land.</p>

<p>The crew of the M.L. moved about the cramped
deck stiffly, for they were clad in duffel suits, oilskins
and sea-boots, and little but their eyes and
hands were visible. The officer on the small
canvas-screened bridge was likewise an almost
unrecognisable bundle of yellow and white wool
and black leather. As a contrast, however, to the
whitening deck and snow-clad men, the reflection
of a warm yellow light came up through the wardroom
hatchway, and more than one longing glance
was cast down into the snug interior.</p>

<p>These men were not all hardened by long and
severe sea training; many of them formed part of
the new navy, gaining experience amid the bitter
cold and dangers of the grey North Sea. A call
for the signalman came from the bridge, and a
boy, who had been swinging his arms to warm
his numbed fingers, responded smartly. The
lieutenant-in-command wiped the snow from his
eyes as he peered round the canvas side-screen and
asked tersely what the next ship ahead was trying
to signal.</p>

<p>The boy seized his semaphore flags and went out
on to the spray-swept fore-deck, steadying himself
against the fo'c'sle hatch cover. He flinched at
first when the spray stung the exposed parts of his
body, and then, with straining eyes and dripping
oilskins, he managed, after the words had been repeated
several times, to read the signal which was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
being sent down the line from the leading ship
somewhere in the white haze ahead.</p>

<p>"Proceed independently to allotted stations for
night patrol" was the order then conveyed to the
bridge and afterwards passed on by flag to the next
astern. When the last ship had received the signal
each unit of the flotilla swung out of line and disappeared
in the sliding snow.</p>

<p>As the darkness increased the cold strengthened
and a little bitter wind began to moan through
the scanty rigging. Men stamped their feet and
swung their arms to increase the circulation in
numbed limbs, and every now and then during the
next three hours one member of the watch on deck
would disappear for a few minutes down the galley
hatchway to drink a cup of hot cocoa, which, so far,
the cook had succeeded in keeping warm on the ill-natured
petrol stove.</p>

<p>At 9 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> the first watch was over and half-frozen
men climbed stiffly down the iron ladder into the
tiny fo'c'sle, where the heat and fugg of oil stoves
caused their thawing limbs to throb painfully.
The starboard watch, fresh from the heat of the
tiny cabin, whose four hours on deck now commenced,
were shivering in the icy wind and showers
of spray.</p>

<p>Glancing at the dimly lit chart on the small
table cunningly fitted into the front of the wheel-house,
the commander noted the approximate
position of the ship in the 140,000 square miles of
sea and snow around, and then turning to the
coxswain, whose "trick" it was at the wheel, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
gave the necessary orders for the course and speed.
The duty of this vessel was to patrol certain
approaches to the great harbour on which the
flotilla was based until relieved at daybreak by
another unit, and, as merchant ships had many
times been attacked in these waters, a sharp look-out
was necessary. To carry this out effectively
in the darkness and driving snow was a task calling
for all the qualities of dogged endurance inherent
in the British sailor.</p>

<p>For over two hours nothing was seen or heard
except the moaning of the wind and the lash of the
sea, but shortly after midnight one of the look-outs
reported the sound of engines away to the starboard.</p>

<p>The M.L.'s propellers were stopped and the watch
on deck listened intently. The splash of the sea
and the many noises of a rolling ship drowned any
other sound there might have been, and the patrol
was then continued. Less than half-an-hour later,
however, the clank! clank! clank! of engines
again became suddenly audible, and the vessel was
turned in the direction of the sound.</p>

<p>The engines were put to full speed ahead, and
as each comber struck the bows the little ship
trembled from stem to stern, and clouds of icy
spray swept high over the mast. The big steel
hull of some man-o'-war or merchantman might
suddenly loom up out of the darkness so close
ahead that no skill could avoid a collision, and the
eyes of all aboard were gazing alertly into the
blackness of the night.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>Five minutes' dash through the blinding, stinging
spray and the engines were once more shut off
to listen. The curious clanking noise had, however,
ceased, and although hydrophones were used
to again locate the sound, there was no result, only
the ceaseless wash of the sea and the low moaning
of the wind. Another mile or so of pounding
through the waves, followed by an interval of
listening, brought the same discouraging result,
and the slow, monotonous routine of patrol was
continued.</p>

<p>The stinging frost of the night became the numbing
cold of early morning, and the long hours in the
snow and icy spray had left their mark on all.
Limbs were stiff and sore. The edges of wet and
half-frozen sleeves rasped swollen wrists. Faces
smarted and eyes ached, but little was said in the
way of complaint, for men grow hard on northern
seas or else succumb to the hardships.</p>

<p>When the first dim light of a winter dawn broke
reluctantly over the grey tumbling sea and whirling
snow another night patrol was over, and the
cheering thought came to all that soon the welcome
warmth and shelter of club and recreation room
would embrace them for the brief hours of daylight,
while others kept watch upon the seas.</p>

<p>It had been snowing hard for the past twenty-four
hours, but as the light of a new day
strengthened it eased somewhat, and away to the
westward the blue outline of the land became
visible. The fitful wind of the night rose to a stiff
breeze, but no one paid much attention to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
increasing volume of bitter spray which swept the
deck as the grey-green rollers put on their white
caps of foam, for the ship was heading towards the
harbour and their vigil was over until darkness
again closed down.</p>

<p>Few things are more trying to the temper than
to be kept waiting for relief after a bad spell at sea,
and but few crimes are more heinous than to leave
the watched area before another patrol takes up
the never-ceasing duties. Therefore, if peace and
quietness and an absence of insulting signals
counted for anything, it ill behove any ship in the
day patrol to keep her opposite member of the
night guard waiting.</p>

<p>This time the relief was late and the M.L. steamed
angrily up and down, with all eyes strained shorewards.
Then the first of the line of armed trawlers
and motor launches crawled out of the harbour in
a smother of black smoke. When barely half-a-mile
of sea separated the incoming and outgoing
ships a loud reverberating boom rolled over the
sea. So great was the explosion that the shock of
it was felt rather than heard, and a gigantic column
of black smoke, rising over 100 feet into the air,
appeared to engulf the leading unit of the trawler
patrol.</p>

<p>Regardless of the danger, the C.O. of the
motor launch sent his swift shallow-draught
boat flying over the mine-field into the floating
debris. The only two mangled survivors had,
however, been picked up by the trawler astern
of the ill-fated vessel, which had been literally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
blown to pieces, nothing remaining afloat when
the smoke cleared away except a signal locker
and a few timbers.</p>

<span class="caption">A Motor Launch of the Naval Patrol</span>
</div>


<p>More than one of the other vessels, whose engines
had been stopped immediately the explosion occurred,
narrowly escaped drifting down with the
tide on to the field of hidden mines, but with the
skill and presence of mind gained by similar experiences
in the past both the trawler unit and
the M.L. flotilla were extricated without further
loss.</p>

<p>It was evident from the fact that several of the
mines were barely submerged and could be dimly
seen from the decks that the work of laying them
had been done hastily under the cover of night,
and a sense of keen sorrow and disappointment
pervaded the vessels of the night guard. Once
again climatic conditions had favoured the enemy.
In those long winter hours of impenetrable blackness
and driving snow no watch, however efficient,
could be relied upon to prevent such operations
from being occasionally carried out. It was merely
the chance of war, but nevertheless it was felt
keenly, and the sense of responsibility was not
dispelled until some weeks later.</p>

<p>When the <i>sweepers</i> arrived it was soon discovered
that the harbour was temporarily mined-in.
Signals were exchanged with the "Senior
Naval Officer" of the base, and the night guard
was ordered to assist in preventing shipping from
attempting to enter the harbour before the
approaches had been swept clear and the mines<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
destroyed. Weary ships with disappointed crews
once more turned seawards, but the physical discomforts
of stinging spray and frequent snowstorms
passed almost unnoticed in the efforts of
the flotilla to prevent the ceaseless stream of
ocean traffic from approaching the danger zone
unnoticed in the blinding white haze.</p>

<p>Tired limbs were forced to continued efforts and
numbed faculties were goaded afresh. Big ships
loomed out of the mists around and were informed
of the dangers and directed into the pathways
of safety. Trawlers returning from the fishing-grounds
of the far north had to be intercepted,
local craft piloted round the mine-field in the
shallow water close inshore, signals flashed to
the outer patrols, and the hours of daylight and
activity passed quickly by.</p>

<p>By seven bells in the afternoon watch the dusk
of the long winter night began again to settle over
the sea, blotting out one patrol from another. On
this as on many other similar nights spent in the
bitter frost, thick sea fog or flying spume, in waters
infested with mines and hostile submarines, certain
senses became dulled, though the brain remained
alert and the limbs as active as cramp and cold
would allow. But the little incidents of those long
hours are lost in blurred memories of cries from the
look-out, hulls towering out of the blackness, the
flashing of Morse lamps, the ceaseless and violent
pitching and rolling of a small ship, moments of
tense excitement, followed by hours of cold and
an utter weariness of the soul.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>When the first pale streaks of returning daylight
had turned to the fiery red of a frosty sunrise, dirty
and unshaven men moved painfully about the
slippery decks. The sea had flattened in the night
and the snowing had ceased, but twenty degrees of
frost had gripped the wet decks and the soaked
clothing. As the vessels stood towards the shore
weary eyes were turned anxiously on the signal
station, but not yet was the recall to be hoisted,
for although the seas around had been swept clear
of mines, there was still a careful inspection to be
made before the area could be reported clear, so
that ships might come and go.</p>

<p>When at last a line of flags fluttered to the
distant mast-head away on the hill ashore, and the
signal-boy read out, "M.L.'s to return to harbour,"
there was a feeble cheer.</p>

<div class='center'><b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</b></div>

<p>On a calm, frosty morning some three weeks
later the boats of the old night guard, now doing
their spell of day duty, discovered a long trail of
thick greenish-black oil on the surface leading seawards.
It was evident that a hostile submarine
had rested during the previous night on the sandy
bottom in the shallow water close inshore and,
rising to the surface, had made off at daybreak.
The trail was followed and information was quickly
received from an Iceland trawler, which had passed
the submarine on the surface some two hours
previous. Ships were concentrated by wireless,
and although it did not fall to the lot of the M.L.'s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
to give the <i>coup de gr&acirc;ce</i>, they had the satisfaction
of returning to harbour with the knowledge that
their honour had been retrieved, and yet another
German submarine would never again commit
outrage on the high seas.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>THE CASUALTY</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">There</span> were duties performed by the new navy
which bore no relationship to anti-submarine
fighting, or, in fact, to warfare at all, unless it was
to the ceaseless battle waged between all who go
down to the sea in ships and the elements they seek
to master.</div>

<p>One such as this occurred at a little northern seaport
in the late winter of 1917, unimportant and
scarcely worth relating except as an illustration of
the diverse services rendered by men of this great
force during the years of national peril.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The gale was at the height of its fury when the
March day drew to a close. The whole east coast
of Scotland, from John o' Groats to the mouth of
the Tweed, was a study in black and white&mdash;the
white of foam and the black of rocks. All the
minesweepers and smaller patrol ships had been
confined to their respective bases for several days,
and in a certain small harbour many of the officers
and crews of the imprisoned ships were spending
their time ashore, in the warmth and cheery comfort
of hospitable firesides.</p>

<p>The boisterous day became a wild night. The
wind howled and whistled over the barren moors<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
and through the streets of the small fishing town.
Houses trembled and chimneys rocked under the
blasts. Although a watch on the signal tower and
elsewhere was religiously maintained, it was of
little value, as all that could be seen in the darkness
to seawards was a hazy mist of flying spray which
the wind whisked from the surface and carried
several miles inland.</p>

<p>Standing back from the sea, and some half-mile
from the centre of the little fishing town, stood a
substantially built house, more commodious and
better furnished than many of its neighbours,
which had providentially fallen into the temporary
grasp of one of the married officers of the patrol
flotilla, who generously kept open house for his
less fortunate brothers-in-arms.</p>

<p>On this wild winter night the interior looked
excessively cosy and inviting. Before a big blazing
fire of logs sat three officers, talking between
copious sips of whisky and soda. Their conversation
was subdued and their inhalations of cigar
smoke long. By their side were the faithful
women who had followed them from the comforts
of home and the gaieties of the great southern
cities to this remote corner of northern Scotland.
They too were talking among themselves and
knitting for the crews of their husbands' ships.</p>

<p>This quiet domestic scene would have gone on
uninterruptedly until a late hour, for it was seldom
that such precious moments of rest and contentment
could be snatched amid the ever-recurring
duties and the turmoil of war, had it not been for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
one of the officers who glanced ruefully at his
wrist watch and then apologetically informed his
host that it was his turn for night duty on the
signal tower.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he risen from the fire and moved
towards the door of the room, however, before the
dull boom of a gun was borne on the howling wind.
All stood still and listened. The women ceased
their knitting and looked up apprehensively.
Then a minute or so later the boom came again,
this time in a lull of the storm, and it sounded
nearer.</p>

<p>The three officers hurried into the hall to get
on oilskins and sea-boots, but almost before this
could be done there came a report which echoed
sharply through the little town. They knew the
sound only too well, for the coast was a dangerous
one. It was the reply of the life-boat crew to the
call of distress, and with one accord they moved
towards the door. Almost instantly it was thrown
violently open and the rush of wind and rain extinguished
the hall light. For the next few minutes
they were struggling against the gale, battling their
way to the lofty little signal station, impeded in
every movement by driving rain, flying scud, intense
blackness and flapping oilskins.</p>

<p>When they had reached the coast and mounted
the rough stone steps leading to the elevated look-out
tower, a clear sweep of the dark, foam-crested
surface was obtained, and the news was shouted
above the roar of the gale that somewhere out in
the night, amid the tormented waters, a ship was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
in distress, though the flying spray made it impossible
to locate the exact direction.</p>

<p>Below the signal tower, and built on a mass of
rock projecting into the half-sheltered water inside
the concrete pier, was the life-boat house. From
this point the white rays of a chemical flare lighted
up the surface of the sea as far as the harbour bar,
which, with its flanking rocks, resembled a seething
cauldron. Into this the life-boat plunged from
its inclined slipway, and was almost instantly
swallowed up in the outer ring of darkness and
spray. The flare died out suddenly and the night
seemed even blacker than before.</p>

<p>After a brief struggle with the wind, now blowing
at a speed of over seventy miles an hour, the men
who had assembled around the signal station made
their way out on to the spray-swept breakwater,
and there waited for the coloured rocket from the
life-boat which would signify that she had found
the wreck.</p>

<p>Nearly an hour passed but no sign came from
the darkness and boiling sea. Then a light appeared
momentarily on the harbour bar and was
lost in the smother of white. A few minutes later
a grinding crash came from the rocks less than a
hundred yards distant from the end of the breakwater.</p>

<p>The groups of sailors standing under the lee of
the wall, chafing at their apparent helplessness
and gazing anxiously out to sea, were suddenly
electrified into action by a few sharp orders from
the oilskinned commander. A minute or two of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
seemingly inextricable confusion resulted in the
beams of a portable searchlight flashing out from
the spray-swept breakwater and lighting up rocks,
foam, and a big three-masted Norwegian sailing
ship, with sails torn, her fore-mast broken off short
and every sea lifting high her stern and driving
her farther on to the half-hidden tongues of stone.
Even as the light played on her she heeled over
to starboard at an angle of about forty-five degrees
with an ominous rending of timbers which sounded
above the roar of wind and surf.</p>

<p>Orders were bellowed through a megaphone, and
again men moved quickly in all directions. This
time a fiery rocket, bearing a life-line, soared from
its tube with a loud hiss and sped across the
hundred yards of boiling sea. It straddled the
wreck. The thin line it carried was soon exchanged
for a stout hawser&mdash;hauled from the breakwater&mdash;and
this was made fast to the stump of the mainmast,
which had followed the other "sticks"
overboard when the vessel heeled over on the rocks.
It was now floating, wrestling and tugging at the
mass of confused rigging, and pounding dangerously
at the ship's side.</p>

<p>One by one the unfortunate Norse crew were
hauled over the harbour bar in the breeches-buoy
by fifty willing British sailors, and the first to come
was the captain's wife and little daughter.</p>

<p>There was but one casualty, and that among
the rescuers. The stretcher was lifted from the
ambulance at the door of the substantially built
house standing back from the little town. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
white-faced woman ran out into the storm. She
had spent a year of nights and days half expecting
such as this, and now that it had come the blood
seemed to ebb from her body, and at first she
scarcely heard a familiar voice assuring her that
it was only a cut on the head from a broken wire
rope.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>HOW H.M. TRAWLER NO. 6 LOST HER REFIT</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">An</span> earlier chapter described the periodical overhauls
necessary to keep the ships of the hard-worked
auxiliary navy in proper fighting condition.
These "refits" were needed not only by the ships
but also by the men who worked them. They
came about once a year and lasted for two or three
weeks, during which time the crews were able to
go home for at least a few days of much-needed
rest.</div>

<p>To describe how everyone, from commander to
signal-boy, looked forward to these spells of leave
is unnecessary. Let the reader imagine how he
himself would feel after nine or ten months of the
monotony and danger, to say nothing of the hardships,
of life at sea in time of war.</p>

<p>There was, however, another consideration, one
seldom referred to but nevertheless unavoidably
present in the minds of all. Each time a refit
came round there were ships which would never
be docked again, and comrades who had missed
their leave. Men told themselves that the luck
they had enjoyed for so long could not last, and
it is about one of these, in a fight against
overwhelming odds, that the following story
deals.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>Three of his Majesty's armed trawlers were
plunging through the sea on their lonely beat in
the Western Ocean. The Hebrides lay far to the
southward, and less than two days' steam ahead
lay the Arctic Circle. These cheerless surroundings,
however, found no echo in the hearts of the
watch below on the leading ship of the unit, who
were lounging on the settees in the oil-smelling
fo'c'sle discussing their prospects of long leave,
for their ship was to "blow-down" for a thorough
refit when they returned to harbour in less than
three weeks' time.</p>

<p>On the deck of the same vessel two officers, standing
in the shelter of the wheel-house, were sweating
and shivering in patches, but also happy with the
thought of the forthcoming reunion with their
families and the brief enjoyment of the comforts
of home after seven long winter months' wandering,
with soul-destroying monotony, over the windswept
wastes of England's frontier. The watch
on deck, with the exception of the helmsman and
look-out, crouched under the lee of the iron superstructure,
alternately swinging their arms and
stamping their heavily booted feet, but they too
were mentally impervious to the dismal surroundings.</p>

<p>Of the second ship in the line the same cheery
story cannot be told. She was jealous of the first.
It would be another two months at least before she
would go in dock for refit; and among the watch
below there were three new hands on their first
voyage, two of whom would, just then, have preferred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
the peace and stillness of the sea bottom to
the friskiness of the surface.</p>

<p>The third trawler was a happy little ship, for
although the junior of the unit she had been very
fortunate in securing a "Fritz" all to her own
cheek less than three months before.</p>

<p>This, then, was one of the units on the Outer
Hebrides and Iceland patrol during the winter of
1915, and they seemed to be the sole occupants of
the leagues of water around.</p>

<p>It was barely eleven o'clock, Greenwich time,
when they reached the last ten miles of their beat,
and speed was reduced so that they would not have
to turn about and begin steaming back over the
course they had come until the morning watch
went below at midday. This was an artful though
harmless arrangement to enable those going off
duty to have a meal and at least an hour's rest in
peace, as on the voyage back both wind and sea
would be astern and the vicious lurching of the
small ship reduced to a minimum.</p>

<p>The time passed slowly, as it generally did on
patrol when nothing exciting was afoot, but a few
minutes before the awaited eight bells the officer
on duty snatched up the binoculars, and almost
simultaneously the look-out gave a warning shout
which caused the attention of everyone on deck to
suddenly become strained.</p>

<p>Away to port, less than half-a-mile distant, the
thin grey tube of a periscope could be seen planing
through the waves, with a fringe of white foam
blowing from its base. There was a hoarse cry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
down the fo'c'sle hatch for "All hands on deck!"
The telegraph tinkled for "Full ahead!" A signal
was made to the ships astern for concerted action.
The gun was manned, and the leading trawler,
now cleared for action, headed towards her under-water
opponent.</p>

<p>The other two vessels of the unit put on speed
and spread out until all three were line-abreast
and about two cables apart. In this formation the
chase was maintained for some twenty minutes,
when a second submarine appeared above the
surface away to starboard. She appeared to be a
large vessel and would probably have turned the
scale at 1000 tons.</p>

<p>It was at this early stage in the action that the
mistake was made. The leading trawler immediately
opened fire, but the range was considerable
and the shells fell short. Signalling to the other
two trawlers to continue the chase of the first
submarine sighted, she headed straight for the
largest of the two hostile craft to engage her at
close range.</p>

<p>While this was in progress the first submarine
came to the surface and proved to be also a larger
craft than had been anticipated. The two trawlers
chasing her immediately opened fire, but her
superior surface speed soon placed her out of range
of the comparatively small guns then carried by
the trawler patrols.</p>

<p>Now came the surprise. Almost simultaneously
the two submarines opened fire from heavy guns.
The shells at first fell wide, but in a moment the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
British officers realised that they were outranged,
for whereas their shells were falling short, those
from the enemy whistled over their heads and
ploughed up columns of white water over a cable's
length astern.</p>

<p>To increase speed and so reduce the range became
imperative, and the steam-pressure in the trawlers'
boilers was raised to bursting point by the simple
expedient of screwing down the safety valve.
For some minutes it looked as though the effort
would be successful, and then the range slowly
increased again and "short" after "short" was
registered by the gunners.</p>

<p>At this psychological moment a German shell
carried away the funnel of the leading trawler
and smothered her decks with smoke. When a
temporary shield had been rigged it was observed
that one of the other patrol ships had been crippled
by a direct hit and was in a sinking condition.</p>

<p>It now became evident that the superior speed
and gun-power of the submarines enabled them to
keep out of range of the trawlers' weapons and to
ply their long-range fire with telling effect.</p>

<p>The officer in command of the patrol at once
realised the mistake he had made when opening
the action, in betraying the power of his own guns
before he was sufficiently close to the enemy to
ensure hits, and he cursed this want of foresight
which looked like costing the life of the flotilla.
Given one direct hit on each of his two powerful
opponents and they would in all probability have
been put out of action, but instead he had only the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
mortification of seeing every shell fired fall short,
while his own vessels were being battered to pieces
by the long-range guns of an enemy with whom he
could not close.</p>

<p>The withholding of fire while hostile shells are
bursting around is one of the many severe strains
imposed on the human mind by modern war, and
in anti-submarine tactics it often means the difference
between victory and defeat, which, followed
to its logical conclusion, is generally life or death.</p>

<p>One hope now remained&mdash;that by skilful man[oe]uvring
the trawlers could be kept afloat until help
arrived; but in those wastes of sea no vessel might
pass for many hours, and even then not a warship.</p>

<p>Such is the working of Fate: the leading trawler
of the unit was to have been fitted with wireless
while under the approaching refit, and with its
aid patrol cruisers or fast destroyers could soon
have been brought to the scene of operations.</p>

<p>Thirty minutes later the crippled ship, the junior
member, gave three defiant shrieks with her syren
and slid under the surface with her colours flying.
For over two hours the others man[oe]uvred to get
one on each side of the submarines to enable them
to get the few shells remaining in their magazines
home on the target, but so great was the disparity
of both range and speed that at five in the evening
nearly half their crews were dead or wounded, and
a little while later the ice-cold water closed over
the leading ship. Still the other fought on, but as
dusk closed over the sea she too went down in this
obscure fight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>No search for possible survivors was made by
the submarines, which glided westwards into the
smoky red afterglow, leaving the bitter cold to
finish the work of death.</p>

<div class='center'><b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</b></div>

<p>A big armed liner of the Tenth Cruiser Squadron
had heard the distant firing and came upon the
scene just before darkness finally closed over.
Four bodies were still lashed to a raft, but in all
except one life was extinct.</p>

<p>When the doctors bent over the half-frozen form
in which a flicker still lingered they shook their
heads. Death waged a stern battle even for this
last relic, but life triumphed, and when the agony
of returning animation had ceased the sole survivor
told the cruiser's mess how Trawler No. 1 had lost
her refit.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>THE RAIDER</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Everyone</span> familiar with English history knows
that it was a severe gale which destroyed the
scattered and defeated units of the Spanish
Armada in 1588, and that, in more modern times,
it was the coming of darkness which prevented
the British Grand Fleet from turning the victory
of Jutland into a decisive rout. Such historical
examples of the effect of the weather, and even
ordinary climatic changes, on the course of naval
operations could be multiplied almost indefinitely.
Not only are the movements of the barometer
important factors to be considered in the major
operations of naval war but also in minor sea
fights.</div>

<p>Comparatively few people are, however, aware
that one of the largest and most destructive of
German mine-fields was laid off the British coast
during the Great War by a surface ship which
escaped detection through darkness and storm.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The barometer had fallen rapidly, and clouds
rolled up from the north-west in ragged grey banks
which scudded ominously over a cold steely blue
sky. For some days the sea had been moderately
calm, but it was mid-winter and quiescence of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
elements could not be expected to last. Slowly
the face of the Atlantic grew lined with white. It
began with a moaning wind which soon developed
into a stiff gale, accompanied by heavy storms of
sleet and snow.</p>

<p>One of his Majesty's ships coming up the west
coast of Ireland found herself heading into the
teeth of the gale. As the afternoon wore on the
wind increased in violence and the ship rolled and
plunged heavily, smothering herself in clouds of
flying spume. The driving sleet made it difficult
to see more than a cable's length in any direction,
and when dusk closed over the storm-swept ocean
the ship was headed for a sheltered stretch of water
close inshore.</p>

<p>Every stay and shroud whistled its own tune as
the gale roared past. Foam-crested waves hurled
themselves in a white fury against the plunging,
dripping sides, piling up on the port bow and racing
aft in cataracts of water which threatened instant
death to any luckless sailor caught in their embrace.
The lashings on the movable furniture of the decks,
although of stout rope, were snapped like spun-yarn,
and much-prized, newly painted ventilators,
boat-covers, fenders, deck-rails and other necessary
adornments were swept overboard by the ugly
rushes of green sea. The iron superstructure and
bridge-supports resounded to the heavy blows of
the water, and the ship trembled as she rose after
each ghastly plunge.</p>

<p>The blasts of wind which struck the vessel with
increasing violence had swept unimpeded over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
5000 miles of ocean and carried in their breath
the edge of the Arctic frost. The sleet felt warm
compared with it, and the flying spray lost its
sting.</p>

<p>The forty-eight sea miles lying between the ship
and the sheltered strait seemed endless leagues,
for the speed had to be considerably reduced to
avoid serious damage from Neptune's guns. The
minutes of twilight grew rapidly less, and with
the coming of darkness a new danger threatened.
The ship was approaching a rock-strewn coast with
no friendly lights to guide her, and every now and
then lofty masses of black stone rose up, dimly,
from their beds of foam. It was an anxious half-hour,
and ears were strained for the warning
thunder from surf-beaten rocks which sounded at
intervals even above the roar of the gale.</p>

<p>Fortunately the entrance to the sheltered waterway
was broad, and almost before it could be
realised the sea grew calm. Although the wind
still shrieked and moaned, the waves rose barely
three feet high. Great cliffs, invisible in the darkness
and driving sleet, protected the strait, and as
the vessel picked her way to a safe anchorage closer
under the lee of the land the wind lost its giant
strength and the howling receded into the upper
air.</p>

<p>Throughout the night the comparatively small
warship rode safely at anchor, innocent of what
was taking place out in the blackness and the storm.
When morning broke the gale had lost some of its
force, and streams of pale watery sunlight shone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
between the low-flying clouds on to a boisterous
sea.</p>

<div class='center'><b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</b></div>

<p>Running before the wind and sea the German
raider <i>Frederick</i>, carefully disguised and loaded
with several hundred mines, approached the
British coast. The gale was increasing in force
as darkness closed down, and heavy showers of
sleet shielded her from the view of any passing
craft. The weather was ideal for her dark purpose,
which was to lay a mine-field over a stretch of sea
where it was thought the Anglo-American trade
routes converged.</p>

<p>For the first few days out from Wilhelmshaven
the weather had been misty with heavy snowfalls,
conditions enabling the mine-layer (and afterwards
raider) to run the blockade and elude the network
of patrols, not, however, without some very close
shaves. On one occasion a large auxiliary cruiser
passed in a snow squall, and during subsequent
movements the raider found herself in the midst
of a British fishing fleet, but passed unrecognised
in the darkness. And now that she was approaching
the British coast, and the scene of actual
operations, the barometer again obliged by falling
rapidly.</p>

<p>It was a wild night and very dark when the first
mine splashed overboard. A snowstorm set in,
and as the work proceeded heavy seas broke over
the vessel, smothering her with spray, but she was
comparatively a large ship, built for ocean trade.
Although the darkness and the snow were conditions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
favourable to the laying of mines in secret,
and without their aid the danger of discovery
would have been great, the rising gale and the
heavy seas rendered the work both difficult and
dangerous, notwithstanding that these deadly
weapons were so arranged as to go automatically
overboard.</p>

<p>Before the last of her cargo had been consigned
to the deep it was blowing great guns, and one
sea after another was breaking over the ship.
Although sheltered waters lay less than fifty miles
distant, to proceed there would mean certain discovery
and destruction, so all through that wild
night, and for many hours afterwards, the raider
sought by every means in her power to battle
seawards, away from the coast and danger, heading
into the teeth of the gale and out on to the
broad bosom of the North Atlantic, all unknowing
that but for the severity of the storm she must
have been observed, probably in the very act of
laying the mine-field, by the small warship riding
out the north-wester in the more sheltered waters
close inshore.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It is interesting to note that it was on this mine-field
a few days later that one of the largest transatlantic
liners was sunk.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>THE S.O.S.</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">A great</span> work of rescue was carried on throughout
the war on all the seven seas by vessels of
both the old and the new navy. This service was
rendered to ally, neutral and enemy alike, but no
complete record of the gallant deeds performed nor
even of the numbers and nationalities of those
saved will, in all probability, ever be available, and
none is needed, for it was a duty which brought its
own reward.</div>

<p>Typical of the way succour was brought by the
naval patrols to those unhappy victims of both
sexes left adrift in open boats in calm and rough,
sunshine and snow, all over the northern seas by
the cowardly <i>Unterseeboten</i> of the kultured race
was the rescue of the passengers and crew of a liner
off the wild west coast of Ireland in the winter of
1916.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It was mid-December, and flurries of snow were
being driven before a stinging north-westerly wind.
The sea was moderate, but the heavy Atlantic
swell caused the lonely patrol ship to sink sluggishly
into the watery hollows, with only her
aerials showing above the surrounding slopes of
grey-green sea, and a minute or so later to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
poised giddily on the bosoms of acre-wide rollers
with nothing but the white mists obscuring the
broad horizon.</p>

<p>It was a wild wintry scene, pregnant with cold
and hardship. The officer who had just come up
from the warmth of the wardroom to relieve his
"opposite number" on the bridge pulled the
thick wool muffler closer round his neck and dug
mittened hands deep into the pockets of his duffel
coat.</p>

<p>In the Marconi cabin, situated on the deck of
the <i>sloop</i>, a young operator was sitting with the
receiving instrument fixed to his head and the
clean and bright apparatus all around. He was
city born and bred, and felt keenly the monotony
of life at sea, although to him came the many interesting
wireless signals from the vast network of
patrols which covered the Western Ocean&mdash;linking
the sea-divided units into a more or less homogeneous
fleet.</p>

<p>Presently a message began to spell itself in
Morse. Taking a pencil, the operator scribbled
various hieroglyphics on the naval signal paper
lying on the desk in front of him; then after a
pause of a few seconds he pulled forward a tiny
lever and began a rhythmic tap on an ebonite
key.</p>

<p>It was the "S.O.S." call and the reply that had
flashed through the ether. A minute or so later
the written signal, giving the appeal for help and
the position and name of the torpedoed liner, was
handed to the commander. A glance at the chart<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
told that young but experienced officer that he
could not hope to bring his ship to the scene of the
disaster before dusk closed down, and a message
was sparked across the eighty miles of intervening
sea asking how long the crippled ship could be
kept afloat.</p>

<p>To this, however, there came no reply, and the
engines of the sloop were put to full speed ahead.
A heavy spray now commenced to sweep across
the deck in drenching showers, and the snow haze
thickened. The pitching of the ship increased as
she raced over the ocean swell, driving her sharp
bows deep into the masses of sea. The limbs of
the watch grew stiff and numb, and a fine coating
of wet salt stung their faces. Eyes ached from
gazing into the bitter wind, and for over four hours
the race against approaching night continued. If
darkness closed down before that eighty miles of
sea was covered all on board realised that the
chances of finding any survivors would be greatly
diminished. Even the strongest vitality could not
long resist exposure to the intense cold, and there
might be women and children in the sea ahead.</p>

<p>Many of the officers and crew of the sloop had
experienced the agonies of cold, wounds and salt
water when cast adrift on wintry seas, and the
memory acted like a whip. As the hours went by
the greenish tint of the sea slowly turned to leaden-grey,
and the pure white of the driving snow contrasted
sharply with the quickening dusk of the
December night.</p>

<p>It was in the last half-hour of the dog watch that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
the sloop reached the scene of the disaster and the
speed was reduced. Scattered over the sea around,
and floating southwards in grim procession, was a
mass of wreckage&mdash;a broken raft, a number of
deck-chairs, spars and cordage, a life-belt and some
oars&mdash;but of boats with living freights there was
not a sign.</p>

<p>Steaming slowly round in widening circles, the
sloop searched while the light lasted, but the
whirling haze of fine snow blotted out the distance,
and soon the early darkness of a winter night settled
over the sea. The cold became intense. The
white beam of a searchlight now flashed out over
the black waters. There was a grave risk in this
betraying light, one not sanctioned by the theory
of war. It made the warship a target for any
hostile submarine lurking around, but it seemed
impossible to believe that a 6000-ton liner, with
probably several hundred human beings on board,
could have been so completely obliterated, and
to the commander of the sloop the risk seemed
justified.</p>

<p>Other ships might have intercepted the S.O.S.
call and reached the scene of the disaster earlier,
but the sloop's wireless, although put into action,
could not confirm this, and so the search was
continued.</p>

<p>On and off during the bitter night the white
beam of light flashed out through the snow. For
a few seconds it swept the sea close around
and was then shut off. In the pall-like blackness
which followed ears listened intently, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
could distinguish nothing except the lash of
the sea.</p>

<p>The sound-deadening qualities of falling snow
would have cut short the range of any cry, for the
human voice at its strongest, and with the atmospheric
conditions favourable, can seldom be heard
more than 1000 yards distant. So hour after hour
of numbing cold went by with nothing to show
except the occasional pathway of light on the grey
slopes of sea and the low moaning wind.</p>

<p>The snowing ceased, and in the cold stillness
which so often precedes daybreak in the north a
faint cry came from the sea, at first so indistinct
and mingled with water noises that it would never
have been heard at all if the engines of the sloop
had not been shut off, as they had been at frequent
intervals during the night, to enable those on
board to listen. The cry was quickly followed by
the "snore" of a boat's fog-horn. A few turns of
the sloop's propellers and in the grey light of the
December dawn a large ship's life-boat could be
dimly seen, away to starboard, when it rose on
the bosom of the swell.</p>

<p>Careful man[oe]uvring placed the warship alongside
the boat-load of half-frozen castaways and
the work of rescue commenced. It was a sad task.
Amongst the thirty-two survivors there were twelve
women and children, seven of whom had died of
cold and exposure during that bitter night. One,
a young Canadian wife coming home to her
wounded soldier husband, had been crushed by the
explosion of the first torpedo and suffered agonies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
in the open boat before sinking into the peace of
death.</p>

<p>To dwell here on the suffering caused by intense
cold, exposure, hunger, thirst, untended wounds,
and the mental agony of suspense, often to delicate
women and children, when cast adrift on the open
sea, would be merely to repeat what has so often
been written, and which will live for ever in the
memory of sailormen.</p>

<p>When the survivors had all been lifted on board&mdash;and
many had suffered badly from frost-bite&mdash;the
search for two other life-boats which it was
learned had succeeded in getting away from the
wrecked liner was commenced.</p>

<p>Shortly before midday the snowing began again
and the wind moaned dismally through the rigging.
Spurts of icy spray shot upwards from the bows
and were blown back across the fore-deck of the
ship, searing the skin of the tired men on watch.
For several hours the sea around was searched in
vain. Flurries of snow obscured everything more
than a few hundred yards distant. Then towards
four bells the storm passed and the air cleared of
its white fog, but nothing was visible except the
wide sweep of colourless heaving sea and leaden sky.</p>

<p>It came suddenly&mdash;an indescribable explosion
with a violent uprush of water, followed by the
hoarse shouting of orders, the low groans of
wounded men and the sharp crack of cordite.
The bows of the sloop had been blown off by a
torpedo, and the vessel commenced to rapidly
settle down.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>The two undamaged boats were lowered and the
survivors from the liner once again cast adrift to
face the horrors of the previous night. Rafts
floated free with all that were left of the crew of
the sloop&mdash;two officers and thirty men. Their
condition was pitiable. There had been no time
to get either food or extra clothing, and so heavily
laden were the light structures of <i>capuc</i> and wood
that the occupants were continually awash.</p>

<p>Barely had the boats and rafts got clear of the
ship before she took the final plunge, going down
in a cloud of steam. A few minutes later the U-boat
rose to the surface about 300 yards distant, and
after remaining there for some time, without making
any effort to render assistance, she steamed slowly
away.</p>

<p>The boats took the rafts in tow, and the wounded,
who suffered terribly from the cold and the salt
water, were all transferred to the former. One of
the women survivors from the torpedoed liner
collapsed during the first hour, and although given
extra clothing cheerfully discarded by the men,
she died soon afterwards.</p>

<p>Seas washed over the rafts and sent clouds of
stinging spray into the crowded life-boats. A
biting frost stiffened the wet garments, which
rasped the raw and bleeding wrists of the men who
tugged at the oars&mdash;partly to increase their circulation
and partly to keep the boats head-on to the
sea. The only hope of rescue lay in keeping afloat
until daylight, when the "S.O.S." call sent out
before the sloop foundered might bring them aid.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
The coast of Ireland lay 300 miles to the south-east,
and so intense was the cold that few expected
to live through the night.</p>

<p>The gloom of a winter afternoon gave place to
darkness, and with the fading of daylight the cold
increased. Men became numb and were washed
unnoticed from the rafts. Others were dragged
unconscious into the already overcrowded life-boats,
which sank so deep in the water with the
additional weight that green seas now splashed
inboard and baling became necessary. Limbs
stiffened in the sharp frost and had to be pounded
back to life by unselfish comrades. Even under
cover of the sails the cold was so intense that only
five women and two children were left alive by
midnight.</p>

<p>Through the long dark hours men struggled
under the drenching showers of bitter spray.
When dawn broke, throwing a pale mystic light
over the acre-wide Atlantic swell, each one knew
that life depended on the coming of a ship before
the light of day again faded in the west.</p>

<p>The snowing had ceased some hours before darkness
lifted, and in the clear morning cold men stood
up painfully and searched the watery horizon for
the sign which would bring them life. Just before
three bells, as the boats rose on the bosom of the
swell, a thin blur of smoke could be seen low down
on the eastern horizon. Had there been strength
left in the worn-out bodies there would have been
a cheer, but now only a slight stir of suppressed
excitement and many a silent prayer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>The limit of human suffering and endurance had,
however, not yet been reached. Some twenty
minutes later it became evident that the ship had
not received the wireless call and was passing too
far off to be reached by any sound signal short of a
big gun. Slowly the trail of smoke disappeared in
the haze of great distance without even a glimpse
of the ship itself.</p>

<p>The spirits of all began to sink as hour after
hour went by without sight of the hoped-for sail.
Then, about eight bells, one of the men standing up
in the centre of the first officer's boat gave a little
inarticulate cry and some few minutes later the
dim outline of a big ship hove in sight. The suspense
was unbearable. Women to whom any
sign of religious emotion was alien knelt openly
and prayed, while men who had suffered similarly
before gazed fixedly at the distant object, knowing
how fickle is Fortune to sailormen in distress. But
the hull grew larger and hope shone on the faces
of all. Men pulled frantically at the oars, while
others waved pieces of sail or clothing to attract
attention.</p>

<p>Now came a surprise. From the pocket of his
duffel coat the first officer produced what he had
hitherto kept hidden for just such an emergency&mdash;a
Very's pistol, with its small-sized single red
rocket. A hoarse cry of joy went up from all in
spite of their exhaustion when they saw the rocket
soar into the air and burst into a blood-red glow.</p>

<p>A short time later keen eyes made out the string
of flags which fluttered from the halyards of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
oncoming warship, and although minutes seemed
like hours, none could quite remember what
happened after. Some say that the cruiser came
alongside them and others that she lowered her
boats and steamed round in a circle. But forty-eight
survivors were landed in Liverpool three
days later, leaving in the wastes of the Western
Ocean a murdered two hundred.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It is interesting to note that survivors from
torpedoed ships frequently showed great reluctance
to leave their life-boats and go aboard the rescuing
vessel, especially when they were within easy
sailing distance of a harbour. After being torpedoed,
rescued and torpedoed again they often
preferred the comparative safety but hardship of
the small open boat to the risk and luxury of the
big ship. This applied more especially to Scandinavian
sailors, whose powers in small boats are well
known.</p>

<p>It should, however, be stated that, so far as
British and American seamen were concerned,
men sailed again and again, after being torpedoed
or mined six, seven and even eight times. It
was this remarkable fortitude of the Mercantile
Marine which saved Europe from starvation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>IN THE SHADOW OF A BIG SEA FIGHT</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">On</span> the evening of 30th May 1916 six of his Majesty's
drifters were lying alongside the quay of a Scottish
naval base having their few hours' "stand-off"
after weary days patrolling lines of submerged
nets. Their officers and crews, with the exception
of one sad-faced company on guard duty, were
enjoying either the comparative luxury of a
corrugated-iron wardroom, situated on a windy
stone pier, or a few the more complete relaxation
of a brief visit to a theatre in a neighbouring town.
There were also many other ships coaling, resting
and being repaired, for the base was a large and
important one.</div>

<p>In the intelligence office an assistant paymaster,
weary of decoding cypher wireless messages from
flotillas, patrols and sweepers spread far out over
the leagues of sea lying between this port and the
German coast, sat talking to the executive officer
on night duty.</p>

<p>About 8 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> a messenger from the wireless cabin
entered with the familiar signal form and the A.P.
spread it out carelessly on the desk in front of him,
taking the sturdy little lead-covered decipher
book from the safe at his side. A few scratches of
the pen beneath the secret signal and the deciphering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
was complete. He looked up quickly and
with a gesture of keen satisfaction handed the
signal to the officer temporarily in command of
the base.</p>

<p>The older man read it and paused for a moment
before replying. It was the brief and now historic
statement that an action between Sir David
Beatty's battle cruisers and the German High Seas
Fleet was imminent. A crowd of orders to be
executed in the event of all kinds of emergencies
were rapidly reviewed in his active brain. For a
brief space the scene of what was occurring out
in the blackness of the North Sea occupied his
thoughts, for he had fought in the battle of the
Dogger Bank and knew what those brief words
really meant. It was the evening of the battle of
Jutland.</p>

<p>Rising quickly to his feet, the night duty officer
seized the telephone, rang up the Admiral Commanding,
who had gone home to dinner, and
hurriedly left the intelligence office to carry out
a host of prearranged orders.</p>

<p>The "old man," as admirals are invariably
called, was evidently ready for the emergency, for
his large grey car tore past the sentries at the
approaches to the base, and in a few minutes he
was closeted with his commanders and other
officers in the small matchboarded cabin.
Charts were pinned down on the table in front
of him, and for the next half-hour officers and
messengers were kept busy with telephones and
other means of rapid concentration.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>In the neighbouring large town the police had
received the order for a "general naval recall"
and were active in the streets politely informing
officers and men on short leave that their services
were required immediately at the bases. In the
theatres and cinema halls the cryptic message,
"All naval officers and men to return at once to
their ships," was given out from the stage or
thrown on the screen, a replica of the night before
Waterloo.</p>

<p>Men wondered and women grew anxious. Did
it mean an invasion or an air raid? Many were
the questions asked as silently seats were left and
files of blue and gold streamed out of the places of
amusement. Taxi-cabs full of officers raced each
other along the streets. Civilians had to give place
to sailors on the tram-cars, and then, in less than
thirty minutes, all was quiet again, except for
groups of people discussing possibilities in front of
the big public buildings. Even these soon dispersed
when reassuring messages were circulated
which hinted at the reason for the recall, and the
level-headed Scottish citizens went home wondering
what the great news would be on the morrow&mdash;for
the fate of empires might be decided during
the night.</p>

<p>As each officer and man entered the base the
gates were closed. The sentries and the officer of
the guard knew nothing "officially," but in the
wardroom at the end of the stone quay the news
of the action was being discussed in imaginative
detail. At 11 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> orders were received for certain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
small ships to get under way with sealed orders.
An hour later came the message that six drifters
were to be cleared of all their war appliances and
were to be given stretchers, cots, slings and other
appliances for the carriage of wounded. They
were to be ready to proceed to sea at 2 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span></p>

<p>All was ordered hurry. Piles of anti-submarine
devices were taken from the holds of these ships.
Other vessels came alongside and unloaded
stretchers, cots and slings, which had been obtained
from local naval hospitals and hospital ships. The
officers were grouped round a commander in the
wardroom having typed orders, which had evidently
been prepared long beforehand, carefully
explained to them. Red Cross flags were served
out, and by 1.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> all were ready for sea.</p>

<p>Other ships stole silently out into the blueness of
the night to strengthen patrols and prevent hostile
submarines from getting into position to attack
the main battle fleets on their return to harbour.</p>

<p>Wireless messages indicating a concentration of
German submarines on the lines of communication
were received. Every armed ship was in great
demand, but over the dark waters, lashed by a
stiff easterly breeze, the gunners of many batteries
gazed steadily as the searchlights played around,
investigating everything that moved on the face of
the waters. Beams flashed heavenwards for hostile
aerial fleets.</p>

<p>On the dark quaysides and on the decks of the
ships hundreds of sailors moved noiselessly about
getting ready for sea. Columns of smoke from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
short funnels of destroyers, trawlers and drifters
showed up black against the indigo void, and ever
and anon hoarse voices shouted orders, unintelligible
from the distance. It was quiet preparation
rather than noisy haste, and although an
air of suppressed excitement did prevail when the
men were mustered and extra hands told off to the
different ships by the light of battle lanterns, it
was more a feeling of hope than one of satisfaction.</p>

<p>For nearly two years these men had quietly
fought the elusive submarine, the nerve-shattering
mine, and endured uncomplainingly the terrible
hardships, arduous work and monotony of patrol,
and now their one fervent hope was a glimpse at
least of the real thing.</p>

<p>In the wardroom on the quay about sixty officers
of all ranks were discussing the possibilities of the
fight while waiting impatiently for the last command
before the relief of action&mdash;"Carry on as
ordered." Conversation centred on the Grand
Fleet, under Sir John Jellicoe, steaming down from
the north. Many had seen those miles of gigantic
warships, whose mere existence had preserved for
the Entente the command of the sea and all that it
implied. Others had served in ships whose names
have been familiar to Englishmen since the days of
Nelson, and now opined that when at last the "old
ship"&mdash;perhaps a brand-new super-dreadnought&mdash;was
going into action on the great day it was their
luck to be in command of a "one-horse" boat
miles from the field of glory.</p>

<p>Four bells had struck when the signal came for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
all ships under orders to proceed to sea. Oilskins
were rapidly slipped on, for a fine rain had commenced
to fall and the damp wind was penetratingly
cold at this early hour. Almost silently the
small grey ships slid out of harbour and were lost
in the blueness of the night.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>When dawn broke over the choppy tumbling
sea the different flotillas were far apart, each
attending to its allotted task. Those engaged in
patrolling the route by which the battle cruisers
would return found themselves acting in conjunction
with a division of destroyers, some of whom
had been under refit but a few hours previously,
but when the tocsin of battle rang out had <i>made
themselves</i> ready for sea in an incredibly short time,
thereby earning the praise of the commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>Information had been received, and later in the
day was confirmed, that no less than five hostile
submarines were known to be waiting in the
vicinity with the object of attacking any crippled
ships from the battle fleets, and it became the duty
of the patrols to clear them away from the lines of
communication. For over twenty hours the seas
around were churned by the keels of a heterogeneous
fleet of ships armed with equally heterogeneous
weapons. Guns' crews stayed by their
weapons until their limbs ached and look-outs
searched the sea with burning eyes. Through the
short dark hours of a May night in northern latitudes
searchlights swept the near approaches,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
while in the black void of sea and sky beyond
myriads of mosquito craft moved over the face of
the waters with all lights out and their narrow
decks cleared for action. Alarms were frequent,
and the occasional yellow flashes and sharp reports
of cordite, some too far distant to be visible, told
their own tale. In the treacherous light of early
dawn the fins of big porpoises were more than once
mistaken for the hunted periscope.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>With the Red Cross flotilla waiting behind the
screen of patrols and defences things had moved
rapidly. Each little ship had been told off to
attend on one or other of the great warships which
were hourly expected from the battle zone.
Stretchers, bedding, cots and slings were piled on
the decks, and extra hands had been lent for the
work of removing the wounded.</p>

<p>Another flotilla was in readiness to replace the
casualties with reinforcements, which had been
concentrated by special trains, in order that the
battle fleets and squadrons might be again ready
for sea in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>At the base trains and big ships were waiting
with every known appliance to alleviate the suffering
which was coming in from the sea.</p>

<p>It was a typical May morning, with a light
easterly breeze, when the first of the great line of
ships&mdash;H.M.S. <i>Lion</i>&mdash;came into view. A hurricane
of cheers greeted her from the deck of every
ship that passed. Then the gallant <i>Warspite</i>, low
by the stern and scarred and torn by tornadoes of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
shell; the <i>New Zealand</i>, scarcely touched by the
fiery ordeal; the plucky little light cruiser <i>Southampton</i>,
holed and battered; followed by cruiser
after cruiser with attendant destroyers, some
with great bright steel splinters of shell still sticking
tight in the gouged armour-plate; others with
holes plugged with wood and broadsides stained
with the bright yellow of high explosives. Gun
shields caught by the gusts of shell were cut
out like fretwork; funnels were blotched with
blackened holes; but of them all not one was out
of action. Few, if any, of the heavy guns and
armoured barbettes were damaged, and all except
one&mdash;the <i>Warspite</i>&mdash;came in proudly under their
own steam. This was the return of the battle
cruiser and light cruiser squadrons, which, under
Sir David Beatty, had met and defeated practically
the entire German navy. Steaming back into
the northern mist was the Grand Fleet&mdash;the
largest assembly of warships ever known&mdash;which,
had it been given the opportunity so eagerly
sought, would undoubtedly have annihilated the
remains of Von Hipper's fleet.</p>

<p>An observer from a distance would have found
it difficult to believe that this was the fleet which
had just fought the greatest sea fight in the history
of the world. Yet the decks of the seaplane carrier
<i>Engadine</i> were covered with men in motley
clothes, a grim reminder of the severity of the
ordeal, for they were the survivors from the
thousands who had manned the <i>Princess Royal</i>
and <i>Invincible</i>. On the high poop a fleet chaplain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
was surrounded by figures in borrowed duffel suits
giving thanks to the God of Battles for their rescue.</p>

<p>As the engines of each great ship came temporarily
to rest a vessel of the Red Cross flotilla ranged
alongside and the more sombre work of war began.
A shell through the sick-bay of H.M.S. <i>Lion</i> had
caused Sir David Beatty to have many of the
wounded on that ship placed in his own cabins.
The only casualty on the <i>New Zealand</i> was caused
by a gust of bursting steel over the signal bridge.
A big shell had passed longitudinally through the
line of officers' cabins in the battered little <i>Southampton</i>,
and many were the curious escapes from
death. In modern naval war a heavy casualty
list seems unavoidable, and the deadly nature of a
sea fight will perhaps be better realised when it is
stated that on one of the battle cruisers there were
just over three hundred casualties, of which number
very nearly two hundred were killed outright, and
this on a ship which still sailed proudly into port in
fighting condition. Where the shells had burst in
the steel flats the fierce heat generated had burnt
off the clothes and skin of many who were untouched
by the flying slivers of steel, and the crews
of the secondary batteries of smaller guns suffered
severely.</p>

<p>Cot cases were the first to be lowered from the
decks of the warships to the waiting Red Cross
boats. The patience and care with which this
difficult operation was carried out may be gauged
from the fact that there were no casualties or
deaths during the work of transportation. Human<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
forms, swathed from head to foot in yellow picric-acid
dressings, were lowered on to the decks or
carried down the gangways. By a curious ordinance
of fate, <i>picric acid</i>, one of the most deadly
explosives known, also provides a medical dressing
for the alleviation of the pain which in another
form it may have caused. The walking wounded,
with arms in slings or heads covered in lint, were
helped down the ship's sides by smoke-blackened
comrades in uniforms torn to shreds by the fierce
work of naval war.</p>

<p>All serious cases of shell shock were conveyed
at the utmost speed by special units to the big
and lavishly equipped hospital ships. Those with
minor injuries were taken ashore and placed in
ambulance trains for distribution among the big
naval hospitals. So perfect was the organisation
that within three hours all the sick-bays
had been cleared and fresh crews placed on
board. The squadrons were again ready to give
battle.</p>

<p>Twenty-four hours later the patrol flotillas
returned to their base to commence once again the
dangerous and monotonous but less spectacular
work of minesweeping and patrol. Their work in
preventing a concentration of German submarines
on the line of route of the returning fleets and in
the removal of the wounded received high praise
from the commander-in-chief. In the wardroom
on the little stone pier a silent toast was given that
night to those who had gone aloft in the greatest
sea fight since Trafalgar.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>A NIGHT ATTACK</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Two</span> drifters, about a mile apart, with no lights to
indicate their presence, were drifting idly with the
ebb tide. It was an oppressively hot night in mid-August.
Scarcely a ripple disturbed the surface of
the sea, but the intense darkness and the absence
of stars told of the heavy clouds above. The barometer
had been falling rapidly for some hours and
all the conditions seemed to indicate a coming
storm.</div>

<p>The duty of these two vessels was to watch lines
of cunningly laid submerged nets (described in an
earlier chapter) and to guide the few merchant
ships which passed that way through the labyrinth
of these defences, laid temporarily as a trap for the
wily "Fritz" if he should chance to be cruising in
the vicinity.</p>

<p>The drifters were adequately armed with guns
and depth charges to attack any such monster of
the deep which betrayed its presence by becoming
entangled in the fine wire mesh and so attaching to
itself a flaming tail, which would then be dragged
along the surface, marking it as a target for all the
pleasant surprises lying ready on the decks of the
patrols.</p>

<p><i>Fishing for Fritz</i> was a popular sport in the anti-submarine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
service until the "fish" became shy
and its devotees <i>blas&eacute;</i>; then the primitive net was
changed for the more scientific devices already
described. It required infinite patience and meant
very hard work, with a <i>soup&ccedil;on</i> of danger thrown
in. For when the tons of steel wire-netting, with its
heavy sinkers and floats, had been laid, days were
spent in watching and repairing, then endless resource
employed to induce a submarine to enter
the trap. Occasionally the voyage ended in an
exciting chase, with the flaming buoy as the guiding
light.</p>

<p>It was in the early period of the war, when Paris
was still threatened by the Teutonic armies and
the Allies waited confidently for the clash of the
great battle fleets. Every dark night on the
northern sea eyes and ears were silently watching
and listening for the comings and goings which
would herald the storm. The strain was great
though the work was not spectacular, for all
knew that the safety of England, or at least
its freedom from invasion, might, for one brief
historical instant, depend on the vigilance and
nerve of that heterogeneous, irregular horse,
the sea patrols.</p>

<p>The great cruiser squadrons were scouring the
North Sea. Battle seemed imminent, and that
vague wave of human electricity which passes along
the firing line before the attack at dawn, and even
extends to the lines of communication, was in the
air on this dark night in 1915.</p>

<p>Six bells had just struck when a faint, cool breeze<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
swept across the surface, and a few minutes later
the first vivid flash of lightning forked the eastern
sky. There was a scramble for oilskins on Drifter
42 as the rain came hissing down like a flood released.
The storm was severe while it lasted.
The thunder rolled over the placid surface.
Lightning darted athwart the sky, illuminating the
black void beneath. For about thirty minutes the
sky blazed and roared, then the hiss of the rain
ceased and the storm moved slowly northwards,
but one of the final flashes revealed something
low down on the surface moving stealthily forward.
So brief was the glimpse obtained, however,
that it seemed merely a phantom&mdash;by no
means uncommon occurrences when men have
been watching for years. When the next flash
came the surface of the sea around was clear.</p>

<p>As was usual in such cases, half the watch on
deck could swear they had seen it, while those who
were not looking ridiculed the idea, so the C.O. said
nothing and took precautions. The watch below
was called and the powerful little gun on the fore-deck
manned. Then all waited in silence, listening
intently for the curious, creaking noise of a
submarine under way.</p>

<p>In those early days of hostilities there were no
elaborate hydrophones for detecting the approach
of submarines under the water, and the only hope
of a warning came from the possibility of the under-water
vessel breaking surface momentarily. The
uselessness of the periscope for navigation during
darkness, which at present forms the principal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
limitation of submarines, made it distinctly likely
that she would cruise on the surface at night, and if
forced to dive would be more or less compelled to
quickly rise again in order to ascertain the position
of her enemy before it would be possible to fire a
torpedo with any chance of success.</p>

<p>For these reasons all eyes and ears on the drifter
were strained to catch the first glimpse or sound,
and dead silence was maintained. It is in times
like this that one discovers how acute the senses
become when danger lurks in the darkness around.
Things undetectable under normal conditions can
be seen or heard distinctly when life depends on
the intelligence so gained.</p>

<p>Long minutes of silence slipped by and nothing
occurred; then came the distant and familiar
creaking noise, almost inaudible at first. The
gun's crew braced themselves for the stern work
ahead. On the rapidity and accuracy of their fire
not only their own lives, but also those of their
comrades, would probably depend. The gun-layer
bent his back and glanced along the grey
tube to the tiny blue glow of the electric night
sight. The shell was placed in the open breech.
Then came those interminable seconds before an
action begins.</p>

<p>The tension would have been almost unsupportable
had nearly all of the crew not grown accustomed
to life hanging in the balance on the wastes
of sea.</p>

<p>A flicker of light, at first almost spectral, appeared
from out of the darkness some 500 yards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
to starboard. It grew almost instantly into a
bright white flare, illuminating the surface of the
black water as it moved along. The pungent
smell of burning calcium floated over the sea
and the drifter's engines began to throb heavily.</p>

<p>The tension relaxed, a subdued cheer broke from
the crew of the drifter as she gathered speed, and
the Morse lamp winked its order for concerted
action to the other drifter somewhere in the darkness
around. An answering dot-dash-dot of light
appeared from away to starboard and the chase
commenced in earnest.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the glare from the calcium
buoy, now being towed through the water at
several knots, shone on the faces of the crew as
they trained their gun ahead, but the submarine
was under the surface and, although probably
quite unaware of the flaming tail which was betraying
her movements, appeared to know that
she was being hunted by surface craft. After
running straight ahead for a few minutes she
turned eight points to the eastward in an attempt
to baffle pursuit.</p>

<p>The chase was a fairly long one, as the speed of
the drifters was not sufficient to enable them to
gain rapidly on their quarry, but the flexibility of
the steam-engine gradually gave the surface ships
the advantage and they crept up level with the
light. Then, with their boilers almost bursting
and flames spouting from the funnels, they drew
ahead until over the submarine itself. Depth
charges were dropped from the stern of the drifters.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
The water boiled with the force of the explosions
and the light on the buoy went out. Still the
drifters held their course in the now pall-like blackness,
and other bombs splashed into the water
astern, to explode with a dull vibration a few
seconds after they had sunk from the surface.</p>

<p>The engines of the two small surface ships were
shut off and every ear became alert, but no sound
broke the stillness of the summer night, except the
rumble of distant thunder and the gentle lap of the
sea against the sides. Morse signals winked from
one ship to the other and back again. When due
precautions had been taken against a further surprise
attack, the chivalry of the sea called for a
search to be made for possible survivors. This
was done with the aid of flares, but only oil and
some small debris were found. Dan-buoys were
dropped to mark the spot and soundings taken.
Twenty-four fathoms deep was added to the report
of the action, and a few days later a diver reported
having found the wreck of the U-C 00.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>MYSTERIES OF THE GREAT SEA WASTES</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> piratical warfare of German submarines produced
many sea mysteries. Some were solved
after the lapse of months and even years, while
others will, in all probability, remain unknown
until the sea gives up its dead.</div>

<p>Among the latter may be numbered the curious
discovery in the North Atlantic of a nameless
sailing ship, without cargo, identifying papers or
crew, but sound from truck to kelson, and with her
two life-boats stowed neatly inboard and a half-finished
meal on the cabin table. Experts examined
this vessel when brought into port, but so
far have been utterly unable to offer any solution
or discover any clue, beyond the fact that she was
built and fitted out in some American port and
carried an unusually large crew.</p>

<p>Another similar mystery was the disappearance
of a French vessel while on a voyage to New Orleans
and the discovery eleven months afterwards that
she had called for water and food at a small port
on the Pacific coast of South America. No further
trace has so far come to light, nor the reason for her
changing course and rounding Cape Horn.</p>

<p>A mystery which remains a mystery to the end
of the chapter is likely to be irritating to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
imaginative mind, but to the following occurrence
there came a solution after the lapse of a few weeks.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Spectre of the Goodwins</span></div>

<p>It was a pitch-black night, with fine rain driving
up from the south-west. The summer gale which
had raged for the past twenty-four hours had
blown itself out, and although the steep seas still
retained their night-caps, the wind came only in
fitful gusts. Away to starboard an indistinct
blur of white foam stretched athwart the sea and
the dull roar from the maelstrom of the Goodwins
rolled across the miles of intervening water.</p>

<p>The armed trawler <i>Curlew</i> bravely shouldered
her way through each green comber as it rose to
meet her, lurching over the seas in a smother of
spray. Oilskinned figures moved warily along the
life-lines, for when a wave struck her tons of water
swept across her slanting decks, submerging the
bulwarks and causing the sturdy ship to groan
and tremble from stem to stern.</p>

<p>In the little bridge-house the dim light from the
binnacle shone on the hard wet face of the commanding
officer, who watched the seas as they rose
up ahead, giving directions to the man at the wheel,
and all the while keeping a watchful eye on the
distant blur of foam covering the treacherous
shoals.</p>

<p>Few except sailormen can realise the dangers
and anxieties of navigation in times of war. The
absence not only of the warning lights which in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
days of peace flash their signals far out over the
seas, marking the innumerable dangers which lie
along treacherous coasts, but also of warships and
merchantmen rushing through the night with not
even the flicker from a port-hole to denote their
coming&mdash;perhaps at a speed of nearly three-quarters
of a mile a minute; a second's indecision on the
part of the brain and nerve directing each ship, a
momentary forgetfulness of that elusive "right
thing to do"&mdash;some second danger to attract a
flash of attention from the first&mdash;even a blinding
cloud of spray at the psychological moment and,
well, two more ships have gone, with perhaps
hundreds of lives. Yet these things but seldom
happened, and the reason was that all that
tireless energy, skill and nerve could do was
done on the sea in those years of storm and
stress.</p>

<p>Some two hours later, and just before dawn broke
over the tumbling sea, an exceptionally heavy
wave struck the trawler full on the port-bow. The
hammer-like blows of the water as it poured on
board and struck the base of the wheel-house and
superstructure momentarily drowned all other
sound. When the air had cleared of flying spume
a big black hull loomed out of the darkness ahead
and seemed suddenly to grow to an immense size,
towering high above the trawler's forecastle-head.
A blast on the whistle, a sharp order and the
trawler swung off to starboard, with the great
black mass perilously near. It was a close shave,
and the watch held their breath while waiting for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
the crash and shock which for a brief second
seemed inevitable.</p>

<p>There was no time for action or signal. The
great ship slid past like some black phantom
framed in the white of flying scud. It faded into
the misty darkness of sea and sky almost as quickly
as it had appeared, and, curiously, no sound of
throbbing engines accompanied its passage.</p>

<p>It took the captain of the patrol but a minute to
make up his mind what to do. He gave a quick
order to the helmsman and a warning shout to the
watch below on deck. The little ship, as she came
about, lurched into the trough of a sea and rose
shivering from end to end. The next moment an
avalanche of white and green water poured over
her, flooding the decks and sending clouds of spray
high over the funnel and masts. Then commenced
an exciting chase, with the seas racing up
astern and all eyes trying to penetrate the darkness
ahead.</p>

<p>The faint misty light of a new day had
brightened the eastern horizon before the mysterious
ship again loomed up ahead. The heavy sea
still running made it difficult, however, to distinguish
any national or local characteristics which
might give a clue to her identity or intentions, and
the suspense was keen.</p>

<p>The two guns of the patrol vessel were manned,
and a three-flag signal fluttered from the jumper-stay
but received no immediate reply from the
ship ahead. Then, after a few minutes' pause,
during which time the trawler man[oe]uvred for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
advantage of the light from the breaking dawn, a
yellow flash belched from her side and a shell
ricochetted off the water just ahead of the mysterious
steamer. Still there was no response; but it
could now be plainly seen that the engines were
not working and that she was drifting before the
wind and sea.</p>

<p>Was it merely a <i>ruse de guerre</i> to gain the advantage
in the event of an attack, or was she a vessel
disabled by the storm which had raged during the
past forty-eight hours? Neither of these suppositions,
however, satisfactorily explained the total
disregard of signals and the warning shot which
had been fired across her bows.</p>

<p>Again a line of flags were hoisted on the trawler's
halyards, this time a well-known signal from the
<i>International Code</i>, but still no notice was taken of
the peremptory order it conveyed.</p>

<p>After the chase had been on for over an hour
another shot was fired from the trawler. The
report echoed across the still boisterous sea and
the splash of the shell just cleared the ship's bow.
Still there was no response, and the trawler's course
was altered so that she would soon close in on her
quarry. As the light increased it was seen that a
stout wire hawser was trailing in the water from
the starboard bow, and suspicion of some new
evidence of sea <i>kultur</i> increased. When the range
had closed to about 1000 yards she slowly swung
round until almost broadside-on to the trawler,
whose guns instantly opened fire in earnest. The
third shell struck the large wheel-house of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
mystery ship, demolishing it completely. When it
became evident that the fire was not going to be
returned, the guns of the trawler again ceased, and
the two vessels drew close to each other. A partly
defaced name, which was rendered indecipherable
by the splash of the seas as they struck the counter,
could be distinguished with the aid of binoculars in
the quickening light of early morning, but neither
officers nor crew could be seen, the bridge and decks
appearing deserted.</p>

<p>Not to be misled by this ruse, however&mdash;for on
similar occasions ships had been blown to pieces
at close range by concealed batteries&mdash;the <i>Curlew</i>
approached cautiously, bows-on, offering the smallest
possible target, and with her guns trained on the
quarry. This sea-stalking is nervy work and must
be played slowly. Twice the trawler circled round
the mysterious ship, and the sun had mounted
high, penetrating the banks of cloud which scudded
across the summer sky and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'tinging'">tingeing</ins> the still boisterous
sea with flecks of golden light, before it was
considered safe to relax all precautions. Even
then the sea prevented any attempt being made to
board the curious craft, and for six hours the
trawler clung to the heels of her quarry, which was
rapidly drifting far out into the North Sea.</p>

<p>The danger of attack from hostile submarines
was great, and the gunners stood by their weapons
although drenched every few seconds by the floods
of heavy spray which still poured over the bows.
At last patience and endurance were rewarded.
The sea calmed sufficiently to enable a boat to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
lowered and with difficulty brought up under the
lee of the mysterious ship.</p>

<p>An armed guard, headed by the sub-lieutenant,
eagerly scrambled up the lofty rolling sides. They
had scarcely reached the deck before their only
means of retreat was cut off. The two men left in
the life-boat were unable to keep her off the iron
sides of the big ship. She rose like a cork on the
crest of a wave until almost level with the top line
of port-holes and then dropped back, catching the
edges of the rolling-stocks. There was a crash of
splintering wood and the next minute two half-drowned
men were being hauled up the sides by
their comrades on deck.</p>

<p>It was an anxious moment, for although the
decks seemed deserted there was that curious, uncanny
feeling which is ever present when facing an
unknown peril. After all it <i>might</i> prove to be a
<i>ruse de guerre</i> or some new form of frightfulness.
There were only six men from the trawler&mdash;a small
enough party, however well armed, if it came to
a fight&mdash;and great caution was observed while
exploring the ship. A signal had been arranged
in the event of treachery, and the <i>Curlew</i>, with
her guns <i>and wireless</i>, would prove a dangerous
antagonist.</p>

<p>All was well, however, for the ship was deserted.
A careful inspection of the cabins showed that the
departure of officers and crew had been a hasty
one, but all the ship's papers had been carefully
removed. The <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'fore-peak'">forepeak</ins> or bow water-tight compartment
was full of water, but the bulk-head had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
held and kept the vessel afloat. Beyond this no
damage was visible above the water-line and the
condition of both hull and engines was good. She
proved to be a Spanish ship, and to make the
mystery deeper her four life-boats were still on
the davits, although swung outboard ready for
lowering.</p>

<p>In those troublous days the fact of the life-boats
being hoisted out in readiness for eventualities
conveyed little or nothing, but when a careful
search proved that many of the life-belts had gone
with the crew the problem became an interesting
one. Had they been taken on to the deck of a
German submarine which had subsequently dived
and left them to drown, as was the case with the
crew of a British fishing vessel, or had they been
conveyed as prisoners of war to Germany?
Against both of these surmises was the fact that
<i>all</i> the ship's boats remained, and a German submarine
would scarcely be likely to come close
alongside even a neutral ship, especially during the
bad weather that had prevailed for the past few
days. Would it remain one of the many mysteries
of the great sea war?</p>

<p>Some few hours later the trawler, with her big
"prize"&mdash;under her own steam&mdash;entered an
eastern naval base and berthed her capture with
the aid of tugs.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The explanation came from headquarters several
weeks later. The s.s. &mdash;&mdash;, of Barcelona, had
grounded on the Goodwins about three hours<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
before she nearly ran down the trawler. Her crew,
thinking that she would rapidly break up in the
surf, had fired distress signals and been taken safely
ashore in a life-boat. The rising tide and south-westerly
wind had done the rest, freeing her from
the dangerous sands.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h3>FROM OUT THE CLOUDS AND UNDER-SEAS</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">It</span> has already been shown that the science of
aerial warfare is closely allied with that of under-sea
fighting. Airships and seaplanes play important
parts in all anti-submarine operations. They
make very efficient patrols and can detect the
presence of both submarines and mines under the
surface.</div>

<p>During the Great War there were stations for
armed aircraft all round the British coast, and the
patrols of the sea and air acted in close co-operation.
It often happened that one was able to
render important service to the other. An occasion
such as this took place off an east coast base
in November, 1916.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Salving an Airship</span></div>

<p>A big car dashed up the wooden pier of a small
seaport regardless of the violent jolting from the
uneven planking. It was pulled up with a jerk
when level with one of the little grey patrol boats
known by the generic name of M.L.'s, which was
lying in the calm water alongside with its air
compressor pumping vigorously.</p>

<p>Two officers of the Royal Naval Air Service, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
a P.O., carrying a powerful Morse signalling lamp,
jumped from the car and scrambled down the
wooden piles on to the deck of the M.L.</p>

<p>A nod from the commanding officer and the
mooring ropes were cast off as the telegraph was
jammed over to "half ahead." Instantly the
powerful engines responded to the order and the
little ship began rapidly to gather way. When
the harbour bar had been crossed the order for full
speed was given and the engines settled down to a
low staccato roar as they drove the M.L. over the
heaving swell.</p>

<p>No word had yet been spoken between the officers
of the sea and air. A brief telephone message to
the little hut on the quayside from the adjacent
naval base to the effect that M.L.A6 was to be
ready to embark two officers from the air station
and was to proceed in search of an airship which
was foundering about twenty miles seawards was
all that had been told, and yet not a single
second of time was lost in getting under way.
All recognised that it was a race to save the lives
of men.</p>

<p>The little ship cleft the seas, smothering herself
with foam, and bluish fumes poured out of the
engine-room ventilators. The first half-hour
seemed interminably long, and the horizon was
continually searched with the aid of powerful
glasses for a sign of the wrecked airship. At last
a faint speck became visible away to the south-west,
and as the distance slowly lessened&mdash;terribly
slowly, notwithstanding the speed of nearly half-a-mile<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
a minute&mdash;the crumpled envelope settling on
the water could be distinguished.</p>

<p>It was a question of minutes. Again the order
was shouted down the speaking-tube for more
speed, but this time there was no reply. The C.O.
rang the telegraph viciously, but without result.
The coxswain at the wheel looked up quickly and
then shouted an order to a deck hand, who lowered
himself down the tiny man-hole in the deck leading
to the engine-room. A few seconds later the second
engineer appeared at the top of the fo'c'sle hatch
and, ducking to avoid a heavy shower of spray,
scrambled aft and peered down the man-hole, from
which blue fumes, somewhat thicker and more
pungent than usual, were rising. The next instant
he too disappeared below.</p>

<p>The air officers were trying to get into communication
with the rapidly sinking airship by
means of the powerful Morse lamp, but without
result, and one of them put his head into the
wheel-house and asked anxiously if more speed
was possible.</p>

<p>Just then the second engineer and one of the
crew crawled out of the man-hole, pulling a limp
figure behind them. The C.O. turned to ascertain
what had happened, and the men, very white and
shaky, explained in a few gasps that they had
found the chief engineer senseless at the bottom of
the iron ladder leading up to the deck, and had
themselves been nearly gassed by the petrol fumes.</p>

<p>Glancing at the blue vapour now pouring up the
hatchway and out of the ventilators, the C.O.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
realised the risk of fire and explosion he ran by
carrying on at such high speed, but he also knew
that men were drowning in the sea some eight miles
ahead, and that the few extra knots might make
the difference between life and death for them.</p>

<p>That the risk must be taken was a foregone
conclusion, but how to keep the engines running
at that high speed without attention&mdash;for it was
evident that no man could live for many minutes
in the poisonous fumes&mdash;was a more difficult
problem. This was solved, however, by the second
engineer volunteering to go below with a life-line
attached, so that he could be hauled up to the
deck when giddiness came on. More than once
this gallant petty officer had to be pulled up
choking and exhausted. He risked instant death
from the explosion of the gas from the leaking and
overheated pipes and engines, as well as suffocation
from the fumes, but he stuck to his post, returning
again and again into the poisonous atmosphere.</p>

<p>Darkness was gradually settling over the sea,
and the flickering light of the Morse lamp&mdash;still
asking for a reply&mdash;made yellow streaks on the wet
fore-deck. Presently a faint speck of light blinked
amid the dark mass of the airship, but almost
instantly went out, and for some time nothing
further was seen.</p>

<p>Barely three miles of heaving sea separated the
two ships when the bright glare of a Very's light,
fired from a pistol, soared into the air. A cheer
broke from the dark figures on the deck of the M.L.,
and a message of hope was eagerly flashed back.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>The last knot seemed a voyage in itself, but
eventually the great dark mass of the still floating
envelope loomed up ahead, and almost instantly the
clang of the engine-room telegraph, shutting off the
leaky engine, gave relief to the plucky second
engineer, who had retained consciousness and control
through that dreadful twenty minutes by frequently
filling his aching lungs above the hatchway.</p>

<p>The sea around was a mass of tangled wires, in
which the mast and rigging of the M.L. was the
first to become entangled. Near approach was
impossible, so orders were given to lower away
the boat. The sturdy little steel-built life-boat
splashed into the sea alongside, one minute rising
on a wave high above the deck-line and the next
disappearing into the dark void below. Figures
slid down the miniature falls to man her and the
next minute were pulling through the tangled
wreckage to where the beam of the M.L.'s searchlight
showed six airmen clinging to a floating but
upturned cupola.</p>

<p>Numbed with the cold, they fell rather than
jumped into the boat as it was pulled alongside.
One was insensible and the others were too far
gone to utter a word. Nothing but the wonderful
vitality necessary to the airman as to the sailor
had enabled them to hold on in that bitter cold for
over two hours after eight hours in the air.</p>

<p>The task of extricating the M.L. from the tangle
of wire stays and other wreckage was a difficult one.
A propeller had entwined itself and become useless
(afterwards freed by going astern), the little signal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
topmast and yard had been broken off by a loop of
wire from the gigantic envelope and the ensign
staff carried away. After about twenty minutes
cutting and man[oe]uvring, however, she floated
free, and a question was raised as to the possibility
of salving the airship.</p>

<p>By this time another M.L., sent out to assist in
the work of rescue, had arrived on the scene, and a
conference between the air and sea officers on the
senior ship resulted in the attempt at salving being
made. Wires that were hanging from the nose of
the airship were made fast to the stern of the M.L.'s,
and all wreckage was, where possible, cut adrift.
This, to the uninitiated, may sound a comparatively
quick and simple operation, but when it is
performed in the darkness, with the doubtful aid
of two small searchlights, on a sea rising and falling
under the influence of a heavy ground swell, it
is anything but an easy or rapid operation, and
occupied half the night.</p>

<p>The huge mass of the modern airship towered
above the little patrol boats like some leviathan
of the deep. To attempt its towage over twenty
miles of sea seemed almost ludicrous for such small
craft, and yet so light and easy of passage was this
aerial monster that progress at the rate of three
knots an hour was made when once the wreckage
had been cut adrift, the weights released and the
envelope had risen off the surface of the water.</p>

<p>Armed trawlers that passed in the night
wondered if it was a captive zeppelin and winked
out inquiries from their Morse lamps. A destroyer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
came out of the darkness to offer assistance. The
cause of much anxiety had been the likelihood of
hostile submarines being attracted to the scene by
the helplessness of the airship, which had been
visible, before darkness closed over, for many miles
as she slowly settled down into the sea. This
danger, however, passed away with the arrival of
the destroyer and the armed trawlers, but another
arose which threatened to wreck the whole venture.</p>

<p>About 5 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> the wind began to freshen from the
north-west and the M.L.'s towing the huge bag
were immediately dragged to leeward. The combined
power of their engines failed to head the airship
into the wind and urgent signals for assistance
were made to the destroyer and trawlers, who had,
fortunately, constituted themselves a rear-guard.</p>

<p>A trawler came quickly to the rescue and got
hold of an additional wire hanging down from the
envelope. The destroyer, in the masterful way of
these craft, proceeded to take charge of the operations.
Her 9000-horse-power engines soon turned
the airship into the path of safety, and with this
big addition to the towing power it was less than
half-an-hour later when the great envelope was
safely landed on the quayside, much to the amazement
of the townspeople.</p>


<div class='center'><br />"<span class="smcap">Unlucky Smith</span>"</div>

<p>There is, however, another side to this co-operation
between fleets of the sea and air. It has more
than once occurred that vessels equipped almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
exclusively for submarine hunting have been
engaged by zeppelins, and actions between seaplanes
and under-water craft have been frequent.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">A Monitor</span><br />The bulge of the "blister" will be seen on the water-line near the bow.
</div>



<p>How a large fleet of unarmed fishing vessels were
saved and a zeppelin raid on the east coast of
England prevented by the timely action of an
armed auxiliary proves once again the truth of
the old military axiom that it is the unexpected
which always happens in war.</p>

<p>It had been one of the few really hot summer
days granted by a grudging climate. The sea was
a sheet of glass, the sky a cloudless blue, except
where tinged with the golden glow of sunset.
Lieutenant Smith smiled somewhat grimly as
he mounted the little iron ladder and squeezed
through the narrow doorway into the wheel-house.
He nodded to the skipper&mdash;an old trawlerman
acting as a chief warrant officer for navigational
duties&mdash;as a signal for the mooring ropes to be cast
off, and mechanically rang the engine-room telegraph.
He had done all these things in the same
way and at the same time of day for nearly two
years. For a long while he had gone forth hopefully,
saying to himself each cruise, "It's bound
to come soon," but as the weeks grew into months,
and the months promised to extend into years, disappointment
gained the mastery and duty became
appallingly monotonous and uninteresting.</p>

<p>This, however, did not cause him to work less
strenuously or to neglect to watch the large fishing
fleet which he guarded on four nights out of the
seven, but each letter he received from old friends<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
in other branches of the King's service brought
tidings of excitement, rapid promotion, or at least
a little of the pomp and circumstance of war, and
he saw himself at the end of it all with nothing to
show for years of danger, hardship and impaired
health. The worry and the lonely monotony,
trivial as he knew them to be, were slowly sapping
his nerve and vitality.</p>

<p>The trawler glided from the harbour on to the
broad expanse of tranquil sea, now aglow with the
lights of a summer sunset. Slowly the coast-line
faded into the blue haze of distance, and all around
the watery plain was mottled with the shadowy
patches made by the light evening breeze.</p>

<p>Settling himself in an old deck-chair, which he
kept in the wheel-house, Smith lit his pipe and
allowed his thoughts to wander, but every now and
then his eyes would search the sea from slowly
darkening east to mellow west.</p>

<p>Although the summer was well advanced, there
were but few hours of darkness out of the twenty-four
in these northern latitudes, and when the
armed trawler came in sight of the widely scattered
fishing fleet, which it was her duty to guard
throughout the night, a mystic half-light subdued
all colours to a shadowy grey, but a pale amber
afterglow still lingered in the sky and the stars
were pale.</p>

<p>Smith lingered a few minutes on deck to finish a
cigar before going below for his evening meal.
Seldom during the past year had all the elements
been so long at peace, and the contrast appealed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
him as a luxury to be enjoyed at leisure. Even the
light breeze of sunset had died away, leaving an
unruffled calm, and the sails and stumpy funnels
of the little fishing craft appeared like "painted
ships on a painted ocean."</p>

<p>For nearly an hour he sat inhaling the fragrant
and satisfying smoke from more than one cigar,
preferring the cool of the deck to the stuffy cabin.
Then a dark blot appeared from out of the luminous
blueness of the eastern sky and it travelled
rapidly downwards towards his flock.</p>

<p>Smith watched it for several seconds, then it
suddenly dawned upon him that the hand of the
destroyer was coming even into this haven of
peace, and a fierce resentment entered his soul.
He heard the distant shouting of fishermen as they
cut adrift their nets and prepared to scatter before
the approaching zeppelin, and in a moment he
realised that the long-awaited chance had come.
It all seemed too unreal to be true, but he rose up
quickly and in a few terse sentences gave the
necessary orders for the guns' crews and engineers.</p>

<p>The whir of the airship's propellers grew rapidly
louder and its bulk loomed black against the bright
sky. Determined, however, to take no risk of
failure, Lieutenant Smith withheld the fire of his
guns until the great aerial monster, now travelling
down to less than 1000 feet, was well within range.</p>

<p>Attracted by the helplessness of a large number
of fishing craft congregated in a comparatively
small area of sea, the <i>destroyer</i> dived to the attack
like some giant bird of prey, unable in the gloom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
which shrouded the earth to distinguish the
presence of an armed escort.</p>

<p>The suspense was painful. Then the muzzles of
two high-angle guns rose up from the well-deck
and superstructure of the armed patrol, and in
response to a low-toned order from the C.O., giving
the height, time and deflection, they quickly
covered the great black body of their objective.
Tongues of livid flame leapt from their mouths and
were followed by sharp reports. A few minutes of
heavy firing and the nose of the monster appeared
to sag.</p>

<p>The men at the guns yelled exultantly, redoubling
their efforts, and shell after shell went
shrieking heavenwards. Suddenly the sea around
rose up in huge cascades of foam and a shattering
roar, which completely dwarfed the voice of the
guns, shook the small ship from stem to stern.
Everything movable was hurled across the deck.
Breaking glass flew in all directions, and the aerials
at the mast-heads snapped and came tumbling
down with a mass of other gear. The cries of
injured men arose from different parts of the ship,
but still the guns hurled their shells, and the
zeppelin, now well down by the head, rose high
into the upper air and made off eastwards. After
dropping all her bombs in close proximity to the
armed trawler she had lightened herself sufficiently
to rise out of range, but whether or not she would
be able to keep up sufficiently long to reach
her base, over 300 miles distant, was extremely
doubtful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>Flames spurted from the short funnel of the
patrol as she steamed at full speed after the retreating
zeppelin, endeavouring to keep her within
range as long as possible. It was a question of
seconds. Before she finally disappeared in the
increasing darkness another long-range hit was
observed and the zeppelin receded from view,
drifting helplessly.</p>

<p>The disappointment at not being able to give the
<i>coup de gr&acirc;ce</i> to the aerial destroyer was keenly
felt by all on board, for a half success is of little
account in the navy. The gunners had done
magnificently, the ship had been man[oe]uvred
correctly and four of the crew had been wounded
by fragments from the bombs dropped <i>en masse</i>,
but notwithstanding their exertions and the luck
which had brought the zeppelin down from the
security of the skies, they had failed to secure the
prize legitimately theirs. That the attack on
the fishing fleet had been successfully beaten off
appeared a minor detail, and the voyage back to
port in the quickening light of a beautiful summer
morning was a sad pilgrimage. Scarcely a word
unnecessary for the working of the ship was
spoken, except Lieutenant Smith's brief explanation
that it was just his luck.</p>

<div class='center'><b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</b></div>

<p>About two weeks later the proverbially "unlucky
Smith" was ordered to report at the office
of the Admiral Commanding, and he had a sharp
struggle to maintain a becoming composure when
he heard the terse compliment and the mention of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
a recommendation from that austere officer,
coupled with the intelligence that the zeppelin had
dropped into the sea off the coast of Norway.</p>

<p>The spell was broken, and the brisk step and
gleam in his dark eyes told their own tale as he
walked quickly back to his ship.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<h3>ON THE SEA FLANK OF THE ALLIED ARMIES</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">It</span> is a mere truism to say that the sea outflanks
all land operations in warfare. Yet how many
people fully realise that the left wing of the Allied
armies in Belgium and France depended for its
safety on the naval command of the North Sea and
English Channel? Had this sea flank been permanently
penetrated or forced back by the German
fleet, the result must have been disastrous to a
large section of the Allied military line, which
actually extended from the North Sea to the
Mediterranean.</div>

<p>Although the security of the North Sea flank did
not entirely depend upon the naval forces based on
Dover, Dunkirk and Harwich&mdash;as all operations,
whether on land or sea, were overshadowed by the
unchallenged might of the Grand Fleet, which
hemmed in the entire German navy&mdash;it was upon
these light forces, largely composed of units of the
new navy, that the brunt of the intermittent flank
fighting and the repeated attempts by the enemy
to break through&mdash;with the aid of all kinds of
ruses and weapons&mdash;was borne for four and a half
historic years.</p>

<p>The detailed story of their work on the Belgian
coast and in the Straits of Dover could only be told<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
in a separate volume, but the following account of
a bombardment and its sequel may not be without
interest here. Its relevance to anti-submarine
warfare lies in the fact that the bombardment was
carried out with the object of destroying the nests
of these under-water craft established in and
around Zeebrugge. Much that has also been said
in former chapters bases its claim to inclusion in
this book almost entirely on the fact that although
it did not deal exclusively with submarine fighting
or minesweeping, it nevertheless formed part of the
daily operations of the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'auti-submarine'">anti-submarine</ins> fleets, and
no account of their work would bear any resemblance
to the actual truth in which such seemingly
extraneous episodes were excluded as irrelevant.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Bombardment and its Sequel</span></div>

<p>There was a flat calm, with the freshness of early
summer in the air. Zeebrugge lay away in the
darkness some fifteen miles to the south-east&mdash;awake,
watchful, but unsuspecting&mdash;when the
British bombarding squadron steamed in towards
the coast to take up its allotted position and wait
for daybreak.</p>

<p>It was a heterogeneous fleet, screened by fast-moving
destroyers, torpedo-boats, trawlers, M.L.'s
and C.M.B.'s. The great hulls of monitors loomed
black against the paling east, and the long thin lines
of destroyers moved stealthily across the shadowy
sea. No lights were visible, and only the occasional
rhythmic thud of propellers and the call of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
an awakened sea-bird broke the stillness of the
morning calm.</p>

<p>The sky was not yet alive with the whir of seaplanes,
and the air remained undisturbed by the
shattering roar of guns and shells. It was that
brief space of time in which even Nature seems to
hold her breath and make ready for the coming
storm. The only movement other than the continued
circling of destroyers was towards the
shallow water close inshore, where powerful tugs
were towing large barges&mdash;flat-bottomed craft
carrying gigantic tripods made of railway metals.
At predetermined places these were dropped overboard
into the shallow sea and, with their legs embedded
in the sandy bottom and their apices
towering high above the surface, they formed
observation platforms from which, in conjunction
with aerial scouts, the fire of the big ships could be
accurately directed on to the fortifications ashore.</p>

<p>These tripods were laid a distance apart and
quite away from the bombarding ships, but a
system of range-finding and signalling had been
organised and an officer chosen as a "spotter" in
each trestle.</p>

<p>The post of honour was on one or other of these
observation towers, alone with the necessary
instruments. The big shells from the shore
batteries would scream overhead; some would
plough up the water close by, smothering the tripod
with spray, and the smaller guns would direct
their fire against these eyes of the bombarding
fleet. The chances were in favour of a hit, then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
there would be nothing left of the tripod or the
spotter, simply a brief report to the Admiral
Commanding that No. &mdash;&mdash; observation post had
been destroyed and later a fresh name in the
casualty lists. It was, however, accepted as the
fortune of war, and many volunteered.</p>

<p>The sky brightened until a pale yellow glow
suffused the east, while behind the bombarding
fleet the western horizon was still a cold, hazy
blue. A flight of seaplanes buzzed overhead and
a few minutes later the dull reports of anti-aircraft
guns echoed across the miles of still water. Tiny
bright flashes from white puffs of smoke appeared
in the central blue, and then having got the range
the great guns of the monitors roared away their
charges and the scream of shells filled the air. The
calm of the morning vanished, and with it the
oppressive silence which precedes a battle.</p>

<p>It was some time before the German airmen
could rise from the ground and evade the British
fighting formations. In the meantime a rain of
heavy projectiles from the fleet was destroying all
that was destroyable of the harbour and works of
Zeebrugge. With the aid of glasses huge clouds
of smoke and sand could be seen rising into the
air almost every second. Objects discernible one
minute had disappeared when the smoke cloud of
bursting shells had moved to another point of concentration
a short time later. When at last the
enemy's planes, in isolated ones and twos, succeeded
in hovering over the fleet the surface of the sea was
almost instantly broken by great spouts of white<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
water, at first far away, then nearer, and the battle
commenced in earnest.</p>

<p>A vast cloud of smoke now hung like a black
curtain between the fleet and the shore. The
M.L.'s were emitting their smoke screen to cover
the bombarding ships. Shells splashed into the
sea all around. The noise and vibration of the air
seemed to bruise the senses, and lurid flashes came
from the smoking monitors.</p>

<p>It was at this stage of the bombardment that the
curious and unexpected happened. A white wave
raced along the surface towards a monitor. It was
too big for the wake of a torpedo and quite unlike
the periscope of a submarine. The small, quick-firing
guns of all the ships within range were
trained on it and the sea around was ploughed up
with shell. The white wave swerved to avoid the
tornado of shot, but continued to make direct for
the hull of the great floating fort at a considerable
speed. Then, as it drew <i>very</i> near to its objective,
a shell went home and the sea was rent by the force
of a gigantic explosion, eclipsing that of any known
weapon of sea warfare.</p>

<p>It was, however, soon discovered that the
mysterious wave came from a fast torpedo-shaped
boat which was evidently being controlled by electric
impulses from a shore wireless station some twelve
to fourteen miles distant, the necessary information
regarding direction of attack being transmitted by
means of wireless signals from a seaplane hovering
overhead, the abnormal force of the explosion
being due to the heavy charge of high explosive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
which such a craft was able to carry in her bow, so
arranged as to fire on striking the object of attack.</p>

<p>With the failure of this ingenious but costly
method of attack precautions were at once taken
against a repetition and the seaplane hovering inconveniently
overhead was driven off. The bombardment
was carried on for the allotted span, by
which time the shore batteries that still remained
in action had found the range, notwithstanding
the heavy smoke screen emitted by the M.L.'s.
"Heavies" were ploughing up the water unpleasantly
close to the monitors, one of which was
struck, though but little damaged.</p>

<p>It was now considered time to draw off seawards,
and the spotting officers, perched on their tripods,
had to climb down the railway irons under a heavy
fire and swim to the ships sent to rescue them.
The tripods were then pulled over on to their sides
by ropes attached to their summits and left lying
in the shallow water.</p>

<p>Under cover of the smoke screen the bombarding
fleet withdrew, after inflicting severe damage
on the submarine base of Zeebrugge.</p>

<div class='center'><b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</b></div>

<p>Some two weeks previous to this bombardment
a warship patrolling off the Belgian coast had reported
a curious explosion in the direction of Nieuport.
The night was dark and the stillness of
summer rested over the Pas-de-Calais. Waves
lapped gently the distant sand-dunes and war
seemed a thing far away, remote as the icy winds
which blow around the Poles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>In the conning-tower and at the gun stations
both officers and men watched keenly, silently, for
the predatory Hun. At any moment the thin
blackish-brown hulls of a raiding flotilla from the
bases at Zeebrugge and Ostend might slide out of
the blueness of the night. The beams of searchlights
would momentarily cross and recross the
intervening sea and then the guns would mingle
their sharp reports with the groans of dying men.</p>

<p>To the nerve-racking duties of night patrol in
the Straits of Dover they had grown accustomed&mdash;indifferent
with the contempt born of familiarity&mdash;but
this did not cause any relaxation of vigilance.
The element of surprise is too important a factor in
modern war to be treated lightly.</p>

<p>So it happened that when, shortly after eight
bells in the middle watch, a momentary flash of
lurid flame stabbed the darkness away over the
Belgian coast, and was followed by the rumble of a
great but distant explosion, no one stood on his
head or lost his breath blowing up a patent waistcoat,
but all remained at the "still." Minutes
passed and nothing happened. Slowly the destroyer
crept closer inshore, but the night was
dark and no further sound broke its stillness.</p>

<p>For two hours she scouted and listened. Little
more than five miles away lay the German lines,
and the theory was that somewhere in that maze of
trenches and batteries an explosion had occurred.</p>

<p>Next day the mystery deepened, for it became
known that a large portion of Nieuport Pier had
been blown away during the night. As this little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
seaport was, however, inside the German lines,
the mystery remained unexplained until after the
bombardment of Zeebrugge, when it became
known, in <i>divers</i> manner, that one of the electrically
controlled boats had been out on a night
man[oe]uvre and, owing to the difficulties of seaplane
observation in the dark, had accidentally
struck the breakwater of Nieuport.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Many of the patrol boats guarding the Straits of
Dover or minesweeping under the fire of German
coast batteries off the Belgian sand-dunes spent
their days or nights of rest (!) in the French seaport
of Dunkirk, returning to Dover only after considerable
periods of work on the opposite coast.</p>

<p>It may be thought that there was but little
difference between life in the British port and that
in the French town, considering the short stretch
of sea between them. The following account of a
night in Dunkirk will, however, give some idea of
the advantage gained by having even thirty miles
of blue water between an active enemy and a comfortable
bed.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">A Night in Dunkirk</span></div>

<p>The night seemed uncannily quiet. In time of
peace it would have passed unnoticed as just
ideal summer weather, but when the human ear
had grown accustomed to the almost perpetual
thunder of the Flanders guns any cessation of the
noise gave a feeling of disquietude, only to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
likened to the hush of great forests before a tropical
storm. The little town of Dunkirk, with its many
ruins, was bathed in shadow, unrelieved by any
artificial light, but the narrow, tortuous harbour
showed a silvery streak in the brilliant moonrays.
Above the sleeping town, with its Poilu sentries
and English sailors, was the deep indigo sky,
spangled with stars.</p>

<p>Custom had taught the few civilian and the
many naval and military inhabitants of Dunkirk
to regard calm moonlight nights with very mixed
feelings. It was seldom indeed that the Boche
neglected such an opportunity for an air raid. Not
merely one brief bombardment from the skies, but
a succession of them, lasting from dusk until early
morning, and repeated night after night while the
weather remained favourable.</p>

<p>Owing to adequate preparations for such attacks
the casualties were generally few, but the loss of
sleep was nearly always great, unless the individual
was so tired with the day's or week's minesweeping,
spell in the trenches, or sea patrol that the "popping"
of guns and the thud of bombs merely
caused a semi-return to consciousness, with a mild,
indefinable feeling of vexation at being momentarily
disturbed.</p>

<p>To the majority, however, it meant not only the
loss of sorely needed sleep, but also hard work
under trying conditions. To realise fully what it
is to be deprived of rest when the brain is reeling
and the movement of every limb is an agony, it is
necessary to have worked, marched and fought for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
days and nights incessantly, and then the <i>moral</i>
as distinct from the <i>material</i> effect of successive air
raids will be duly appreciated by those fortunate
ones who spent the years 1914 to 1918 remote from
the menace.</p>

<p>Although Dunkirk on this particular August
night seemed uncannily quiet, the hour was not
late. By Greenwich time it was but a few minutes
past nine, and two bells had only just sounded
through the many and diverse ships lying in tiers
alongside the quays. So warm were the soft
summer zephyrs, which scarcely stirred the surface
of the water, that on the decks of many of these
war-worn sweepers and patrols men lay stretched
out under the sky in the sound sleep of exhaustion,
while on the quays and at other points in the half-wrecked
town steel-helmeted French sentries kept
watch.</p>

<p>Of the British naval forces based on this little
French seaport few were ashore, as, without special
permission, both officers and men had to remain on
their ships after sunset, and those not playing cards
or reading in the cabins were lounging and smoking
on deck. Blot out of the view the ruined
houses, the shell-holes in the streets, the guns, the
dug-outs and the sentries, and few scenes more unlike
the popular conception of a big war base, with
the enemy only a few miles distant, can be imagined.</p>

<p>But Dunkirk in that year of grace, 1917, did not
always wear so peaceful a garb. There were frequent
periods when the shells whistled over or on
to the town, when the earth trembled from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
concussion of high explosives, when buildings
collapsed or went heavenwards in clouds of dust,
when the streets were illumined with the yellow
flash of picric acid, or were filled with clouds of
poisoned gas, when ambulances clattered over the
cobblestones, trains of wounded rolled in from the
firing line and the killed and maimed were landed
from the sea.</p>

<p>The first indication of the change from calm to
storm came at the early hour of 10 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, when the
air raid warning sounded throughout the town.
On the quayside all was ordered haste. Mooring
ropes were cast off with a minimum of shouting,
and the larger ships moved slowly down the harbour
towards the open sea. The few small vessels left
seemed to crouch under the dock walls.</p>

<p>Sentries left their posts to take shelter in the
great dug-outs, constructed of heavy timbers and
sand-bags. These were situated at convenient
points throughout the battered little town. In
the houses some people descended to the cellars,
but many remained wherever they happened to be,
while in the cabins of the few ships which remained
in harbour the games, the reading, the letter-writing
and, in a few cases, even the sleeping went on undisturbed.</p>

<p>After a short interval of oppressive silence,
during which time no light or sound came from the
seemingly deserted town, a faint whir of propellers
became just audible in the stillness of the
summer night. Then it died away momentarily.
Suddenly a bright glare, like that of a star-shell, lit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
up the roofs and streets, and almost simultaneously
came the dull vibrating report of a bomb. It
sounded from the direction of the cathedral.
Searchlights flashed out from various points, but
their powerful rays were lost in the luminous vault
above. Guns roared and bright flashes appeared
like summer lightning in the sky. Every few
seconds the town trembled from the shock of
exploding bombs, first at one point and then at
another, but nothing could be seen of the raiding
squadron. Pieces from the shells bursting overhead
and fragments of bombs and shattered
masonry fell like rain into the streets and into the
waters of the harbour.</p>

<p>On the quayside a big aerial torpedo had
made a crater large enough to bury the horse which
it had killed in a near-by stable. A few seconds
later another bomb fell close to a minesweeper and
a fragment gashed the decks but did not penetrate
them. In the cabins the concussion of almost
every bomb which fell on shore was felt with
curious precision. The glass of wheel-houses and
deck cabins was shattered, and the rattle and thud
on the decks and iron sides denoted the storm of
falling metal.</p>

<p>The din of the raid went on for some time and
then died away with a final long-range shot from
"Loose Lizzie" on the hills behind. When all
was clear heads appeared from hatchways, dug-outs
and cellars. People searched the sky
curiously in an endeavour to make sure that there
was "no deception," although from first to last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
nothing had been seen of the raiders except by
those with the instruments, the searchlights and
the guns. The latest news of the damage caused&mdash;two
houses, a man and a horse&mdash;went from mouth
to mouth. Then the summer night regained its
tranquillity and Dunkirk slept.</p>

<div class='center'><b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</b></div>

<p>The familiar boom sounded its loudest in the
stillness of the night and the ground seemed to
tremble the more violently because of the darkness.
It was 1 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> The young moon had sunk beneath
the horizon and a light film of cloud had drifted
over the sky.</p>

<p>The old French reservist doing sentry-go on the
quay glanced up with a shrug of indifference
and slowly shouldering his rifle walked leisurely
towards a dug-out. Searchlights became busy
exploring the sky. This time their rays were not
lost in the opaque blueness above, but went up in
well-defined columns of light until reflected on the
lofty clouds. Presently the beams concentrated
and, when the eyes had grown accustomed to the
glare, little white "butterflies" were seen circling
in the upper air. Then the guns opened fire and
white puffs, like tiny balls of cotton-wool, appeared
among the butterflies. The earth trembled with
the explosion of falling bombs and the recoil of
anti-aircraft batteries. A little flicker of yellow
light appeared in the circle of white. The guns
increased in violence. The yellow light grew in
size. It was falling. The burning machine
crashed to earth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>The bombs and the gun-fire lasted for some
twenty minutes and then ceased suddenly, as if
by prearranged signal. Allied squadrons were in
the air and the distant crackle of machine guns
sounded from the skies. It died away, however,
almost immediately, but the raiders were chased
back to within their own lines minus two of their
number.</p>

<p>With the coming of dawn two solitary hostile
machines circling at a fairly low altitude could be
seen. They dropped no bombs, but the reason for
their presence was soon apparent. Shells from
the long-range guns behind the German lines
began to moan, whistle and burst in and around
the luckless town. A hit was signified by a cloud
of smoke, dust and debris, and ambulances again
became busy in the stone-paved streets.</p>

<p>One shell, carrying sufficient explosive to blow
up an average-sized ship, ploughed up the water
of the harbour, but did no damage, and by 6 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>
Allied squadrons had chased away the hostile
aerial observers. Once again the peace of an
ideal summer morning reigned over the historic
town.</p>

<p>The few minesweeping and other ships which
had remained in the harbour through the night
now commenced to show signs of returning life
and activity. Heavy brown smoke poured from
the funnels of some, the staccato noise of oil engines
came from others, and men were busy on the decks
of all. The night's "rest" was over and the vital
work of sweeping, possibly under an irritating fire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
from shore batteries and the strain of a necessarily
ever-alert patrol, commenced afresh. The steady
barometer promised a fine day for the harvesting
of mines and, for the ships that returned, another
night's <i>rest</i> similar to the previous three!</p>
